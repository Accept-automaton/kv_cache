Yes the Bears had a losing record, but they competed in “almost” every game (the games Cutler was injured we didn’t have a chance because we let former Notre Dame “spectacular” Jimmy Clausen play as our backup). John Fox has always had success in his second season with a team, and I think that his disciplined style of football gives the Bears a great chance. Also, GM Ryan Pace has added some great pieces to the team by signing the likes of Danny Trevathan and Jerrell Freeman to the defense; and Josh Sitton and Bobby Massie to the struggling offensive line. With adding talented players, Pace has managed to anger some fans with the departures of standouts Matt Forte, Martellus Bennett, and Robbie Gould. Forte is the only one I have a problem with releasing. He is for sure one of the best RB’s the Bears have ever had. I get he was getting up there in age, but to get rid of him because we have faith in a back who had an OK year last season scares me. Let us not forget the mistake the Bears made a few years ago by letting Thomas Jones go because they had all the faith in the world in a young Cedric Benson. TOTAL BEARS MOVE! I am so happy to see Martellus Bennett gone. He was a good TE, but way too much baggage came with him in the locker room. Robbie Gould will be missed, but HE MISSED TWO game winners that crushed any hopes of making the playoffs (you win those two games and then possibly take the last game vs Detroit at home a little more seriously making them 9-7). Yeah he did win key games for the Bears, but you have to look to the future. I am not saying the new kicker will be as great or is the future, but hopefully he doesn’t cost the Bears any games. Easy Schedule. The Bears take on the most overrated division in football, the NFC East, and a pretty bad AFC South. Do not let any “expert” fool you and say that any team from the NFC East poses a threat. The Cowboys lost Romo so they are done; the Redskins, I admit, are talented but they can’t win a Super Bowl; the Giants will manage to beat good teams but lose to BAD teams; and the Eagles will “Fly” into last place. I am not afraid of any of those teams. The AFC South has a strong Texans defense and a turnaround Colts offense. However, both will be beatable! The Titans and Jags… well let’s just say sit back and RELAX! The Bears first 4 games are Texans, Eagles, Cowboys, Lions. The Bears COULD be 4-0 after these games. I personally think they will find a way to blow it and go 2-2, but I will touch on that later. Yes the NFC North is still a tough division, but if the Bears can go . 500 in division play, then playoffs here we come!"}

More recently, the Supreme Court has considered whether “secular humanism” is, or is not, a religion.

Second, even if a successful attack was carried out, the cost in terms of Iran’s retaliation and international reputation could be high. Iran could rain down missiles on Israel and US forces and allies in the region, temporarily close the Strait of Hormuz (affecting international oil supply and prices), and use its proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Afghanistan and Iraq to wreak havoc on Israel and Western troops and interests. Furthermore, the US and Israel could suffer a further hit to their international reputation, weakening their ability to isolate Iran after the use of the military option. Finally, even if Iran’s facilities were destroyed, Iran’s technical capacity would likely remain intact."}

{"text": "Mammalian Heart Conserved Throughout Evolution During the many years of study of form and function of mammalian hearts from mouse to whale we found no fundamental differences between the hearts and circulation of otherwise widely dissimilar species [9]. It became apparent that the heart, when compared with most other organs or parts of the mammalian body, has been rather insensitive to the effect of evolution. This conservation of the heart’s anatomical appearance and also of its functional performance is remarkable when compared with the notable diversity in body size and shape of mammalian species. It would be useful to present an index of conservation of organs per mammalian species, because each organ has its own morphological and functional parameters. But how to compare the comparison between diastolic and systolic pressures in the four chambers of the hearts of all mammals, with for instance the composition of urine of camels living in the desert versus that of dolphins living in the ocean? With the exception of the heart, all other organs as well as all senses in the bodies of mammalian species seem to display often strong dissimilarity in function. What could be the reason for the mammalian heart to remain so well conserved during evolution while most other organs in mammals (and maybe in other classes as well) show dramatic changes? Evidently, the archetype of the mammalian heart has been so successful that its original design could not be improved upon [10]. Although impossible to prove, it is almost certain that the contemporary mammalian species inherited their hearts from our common ancestors, the placental mammals, of which the first originated in the Mesozoic, around 125 million years ago. The currently living mammals date back to the end of Cretaceous and beginning of Cenozoic, 65 million years ago [11, 12]. Charles Darwin called evolution ‘descent with modification’ or adaptation by natural selection; ‘a more technical, modern definition of evolution is a change in the genetic composition of a population over time’ [13, 14]. Evolution shaped all forms of life to warrant survival during the (ever) ongoing changes in local physical conditions on earth such as climate and geology or in the community of organisms that a given species interacts with. In mammals (and not only in mammals) this has resulted in a spectacular diversity of ecomorphological specialisation, apparently with the exception of the heart. Small changes, yes, and functional adjustment to varying body sizes (scaling aspects) or shape of course, but an amazing overall similarity between the hearts of all mammals seems to be the rule. We may even suggest that: ‘The heart does not know in what mammal it functions’."}

The benign and emancipatory side of the same thing is that a person is not at the mercy of his/her biological or cultural gender, one is not 'born to become a man (or a woman)', but can instead understand that his/her gender identity was and continually is formed by culture and s/he can and should take the steering wheel in this process – to be an active subject, not a printout of cultural prejudice.\"[1]"}

Also, the Bears offensive line just got a whole lot better by adding Sitton. The Texans do not have a good offense, sorry Brock! Osweiler will not be worth his ridiculous contract, granted the Bears secondary is a joke and will make him look like he is pretty good. They do have a decent RB in Lamar Miller and I think he will create some problems for the D. This is how I foresee the ending of Sunday’s game: The Bears, trailing by 4, get the ball back after a nice defensive stand late in the 4th quarter. It’s the 2 minute drill and they are marching down the field. They have it on the Texans 30 yard line with less than a minute to go, I finally put the Miller bottle down as my mom is yelling at me for spilling on the carpet too much from jumping up and down/I feel like I can puke from eating too many Polish Sausages. BUT THEN, 1 of 3 things will happen: A) Cutler gets blindsided by Watt and fumbles the football. B) Cutler throws a TERRIBLE interception right to a defender not even covering anyone. OR C) “Smokin” Jay Cutler hits Zach Miller deep in the endzone and I sprint to Kenny’s (the local Irish bar) and drink Miller Lites like they are going out of style!! Like I said, the Bears have every chance in the world to win this game and I think their chances are great, but do not count on them pulling it off. MILLER LITE COUNT: 5.

Pearce claims also that he once kicked Gullit up in the air during a training session, and a number of other players sniggered at this due to Gullit's poor relationship with them.[8]"}

For example, under the Khatami administration in 2001, Iran aided the US invasion of Afghanistan in the hopes of defeating a common enemy, the Taliban, and creating better relations with the US. During the Chechen wars Iran abstained from aiding Muslim Chechen rebels and instead opted for smooth relations with its Russian neighbor. In the 1980s, Iran cooperated with The Ronald. H. Reagan administration and Israel in order to procure weapons in its fight against Saddam. Even Israel’s much vaunted strike on the Iraqi Osirak nuclear plant is believed to have been a success as a result of Israeli-Iranian cooperation. In all of these contexts, and many more, Iran acted as a rational actor interested in self-preservation and increasing its power, and is likely to continue acting in this way far into the future. When the US fully recognizes this, and is willing to use both coercion and payments to deal with Iran, it is likely to come much closer to resolving outstanding issues, including the very serious threat of nuclear weapons proliferation in the Middle East."}

The warning signs might be visible to friends and neighbors, but police officers and other authorities new to the situation may not have the training to recognize the symptoms. Even in cases where they are recognized, victims are frequently reluctant to press charges or seek help. The sad truth is that the majority of homicides occur after a continuum of behavior that persisted without intervention or interruption."}

If Rush Limbaugh gave certain people refuge from political correctness, and if Fox gave cable news viewers a conservative answer to a partisan “mainstream media,” the Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin and Paula Deen networks, which are less openly oppositional and political, give subscribers — many of the same people, now older — shelter from a culture from which they feel increasingly excluded. It is, for all intents and purposes, a white ethnic media — a crude reflection of a largely imagined approach to writing and broadcasting and culture-making. If avoiding or dismissing the topic of race weren’t such a fundamental feature of the identities that Dean and Palin and Beck’s site’s serve, you could imagine Roosh-like mission statements for all of them: I aim to protect the interests of white Christian families, a category I’m in..

If one has built one’s ego, one’s day-to-day enjoyments, in short one’s life, on a foundation of gaining social satisfaction from word games and Team-Science signaling, then it’s likely that a long and winding road will lie ahead, as mainstream society won’t exactly stand in wait with open arms, and one’s own psychology won’t make the value-based transition easy. Most long-standing members of Team Science would, for example, find it ridiculous to hear that pursuing sexual/romantic relationships with “unintelligent” (i.e., non-intellectual) people could be a more rational path in life. They’ve developed their smarts in conjunction with a view of the world which places smarts at the top of the list of what’s important, and thus diving into the mainstream social scene and initially getting rejected by people they’ve long thought were lower than them would be simply too much to take. The first step, then, is to recognize that if you look and act like a nerd while they look and act like an attractive person, you’ve done something wrong that they’ve done right.

Rather, it's a limitation on the right to lethal self-defense: In those states that recognize it (now a substantial minority), you're not allowed to use lethal force to defend yourself if you can avoid the necessity for lethal force by retreating with complete safety. This limitation applies even when you're otherwise entitled to use lethal force (i.e., you're being threatened with death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, rape, or, depending on the state, some other crimes), and even when you're in a place you have every right to be. The limitation generally doesn't apply, even in duty-to-retreat states, when you're in your own home."}

Zero Suit Samus is awesome in general and from what I am researched and looked up, nearly to no one has come up with a Dark Zero Suit samus but a small select few..SO This is what I came up with. she didn't come out like, a slimy sonic chaos looking Zero Suit Samus, and I wanted to kinda steer away from that because that's the only decent character concept design I saw for her, and I kinda wanted her to be more my own. She didn't come out super different from the original Zero Suit Samus which is kinda sad but at the same time I'm kinda fine with that.With her character design, I did some studying of the original Dark Samus which is the in-suit version, and tried to take features of that. I wanted her suit to look more fleshy and skin like, but not like she was naked, ya know like, Biological not so much mechanical being as Phazon is a biological matter and only takes on Machines if there are already machines to be corrupted. I mean even Dark Samus with her suit, if you look closely her shoes are actually skeletal feet and same with her left hand, as if the machine look is actually biological but takes on the density and shape of what Phazon noted samus to look like which is in her suit. So I tried to go for that and the skin/suit parts came out kinda scaly alien looking, which is totally fine being metroid and all. And then, which the skeletal look that Dark samus had I wanted Dark Zero Suit samus to have a similar effect, but I didn't want her to look like a zombie, so after a little bit of thinking and experimenting with an airbrush, I made the purely phazon parts to have bones in themas well as muscle lining over it (or so I attempted, don't know if I succeeded or not :I) then like, I went for platnum blond hair but. and I wanted to incorporate her whip to blend into her hand. so . uh. yeah idk XD haha.. SO YEAH a bit there XDidk if anyone noticed, but I tried out using two new brushed that I didn't even know I had in photoshop elements 11. a cool dry brush and a like streeky comb looking brush. I've seen other artists use these brushes and others which I still don't have and I always ADORED that look and whished I could experiment with it. but I never thought I could because I only have the little brother of CS Photoshop and is missing a ton of the really cool features it has, such as brushes and customizing them"}

It takes quite a while to get through all the necessary (and not communicated) milestones in the campaign that open up new card pack and options. Your mileage may vary; on the one hand, it's a great way to slowly introduce you to new materials, but on the other, it made me struggle with deciding to do side-quests for more story and practice vs. beating my head against the harder progression in case I unlocked new cards. And as for the AIs, in Culdcept 360, I loved making AIs with custom decks and watching them face off, so I'm very sad to see it go. It was a great way to see cards in action that I didn't prefer to use myself, but still get to see my ideas at work--not to mention making crazy decks just to see if the AI could win against itself, frustration-free. Anyway, it was ostensibly replaced with online mode which to many people is more important (though not to me)."}

{"text": "The extensive research that Judge and Berg did helped them develop a show that’s packed full of dead-on details–something that Berg says doesn’t always work when researching a show. “If you’re writing sci-fi, I always find that research hurts you, in a way, because all it does is tell you what you can’t do,” says Berg, who served as a writer on Seinfeld and executive producer of Curb Your Enthusiasm in addition to writing the screenplays for The Cat in the Hat and The Dictator. “But with this, the more real stuff we could find, the more funny stuff we could put in the show.” And that real stuff, the tech-world excesses that shape the show, are unique in their form to Silicon Valley. There are other places and fields where people have billions of dollars, and other places where people think they’re doing the most important work there is, but there aren’t many places where people believe that their seemingly inconsequential and hard-to-understand application is the key to a better future for everyone, and thus they deserve billions of dollars for what they’ve created. Which leads to the challenge that comes with depicting such a singular culture. The first two episodes of Silicon Valley were a smash hit at SXSW, where they screened in front of an audience for the first time, but that’s a community that is intimately familiar with the world that the show depicts. How do you take the unique, unlikely blend of ideals that make up Silicon Valley and present it in a way that’ll play way, way outside Palo Alto? For Judge, the answer’s simple: You look to Dr. Dre. “I make a weird comparison, but in my mind, it makes sense–which is the ‘gangsta rap’ thing. Dr. Dre used to always say it has to appeal to people in the neighborhood on the streets, and then go from there,” Judge explains. “This is similar. If you don’t have any credibility among the people that it’s about, then I don’t think that it works–but I don’t think we’re even close to making something that only works if you live in Silicon Valley.” To ensure authenticity, during the development process Judge and Berg workshopped Silicon Valley’s fictional company, pitching it to actual tech industry insiders and venture capitalists."}

{"text": "Jake Esch is the Marlins’ current number nine prospect and an 11th round draft pick from 2011. He stands at an athletic 6’3″, 205 and owns a four pitch arsenal consisting of a 93-96 fastball which he can spot corner to corner. He can also pitch off of the other end of his velo range, a mid 80s slider that has 10-3 movement with late bite. His ability to lead hitters off with both ends of the spectrum allows him to keep hitters off balance despite what they may see from the on-deck circle. He mixes in a still improving mid-80s change which also flashes above average and which plays off his fastball well, especially against opposing righties which he last year with the Suns held to just a .200 BAA. The Esch curveball is the least progressed of his pitches but although the spin needs to be improved, it has good 11-5 shape and can make hitters look silly when he places it correctly. After getting off to a great start in AA last year in which he held down a 3.48 ERA through 85 innings with a 68/33 K/BB, Esch received the call to AAA. However, being just 400 innings into his career as a pitcher (he came up through high school and college primarily as an infielder which allows him to field his position extremely well), he understandably proved he needs more seasoning in AA. While he is a bit old to begin a repeat season at the sub-AAA level, Esch has made great strides in a short amount of time. Should he continue to build upon a second great start that he has gotten off to in Jacksonville this year (2.93 ERA, 21/8 K/BB, 1.05 WHIP through is first 27.2 IP), he should get a better timed call to AAA and, with similar success there, could make an impact with the Marlins as early as next season."}

{"text": "This question is the first thing crooned by vocalist-and-guitarist Stian Økland on Seven Impale‘s sophomore album, Contrapasso. It was also the question burning in my mind after several months of listening to their debut album, City of the Sun, which was my favorite record of 2014. I’ve heard plenty of bands with elements of both jazz and prog rock, but never one that truly synthesizes those styles in perfect balance. Typically you can feel whether a band is rooted in jazz and incorporating some elements of prog or vice versa. With this Norwegian sextet, such a distinction is impossible; they are exactly, as their facebook puts it, “progressive jazzrock”. They exemplify this sound on the five tracks of City of the Sun, presenting themselves as some glorious hybrid of King Crimson, The Mars Volta, and Jaga Jazzist. But we can all name bands that launched themselves onto the scene with an incredibly promising debut, only to faceplant with a disastrous follow-up that stripped away whatever made them good to begin with. So where would Seven Impale go? Play it safe and offer more of the same? Not the worst idea, since they had crafted an excellent and unique sound already. Go 4/4 and become the prog world’s version of Kenny G? Unlikely, though not impossible. Or would they keep their roots but also work in some new angles? Could they do this without compromising their identity, or ending up just another one-album wonder?"}

Actual peaks exist, and they are hard to call. IBM hit its peak with the ES/9000 bi-polar mainframe in 1990, when prices actually went up for mainframe capacity, to a whopping $100,000 per MIPS.

The archive of networked programmes made by Southern Television, for example, is now owned by the otherwise-unconnected Australian media company Southern Star Group but Southern's regional output is in the hands of ITV plc. The few surviving tapes of Associated-Rediffusion belong to many different organisations as the majority of Associated-Rediffusion's tapes were recorded in monochrome and therefore deemed of no use upon the arrival of colour broadcasting; as such they were disposed of by London successor Thames Television), although in recent years there have been occasional discoveries such as a 1959 episode of Double Your Money and the remaining missing episode of Around the World with Orson Welles, found by Ray Langstone in 2011. Many master tapes belonging to ATV have since deteriorated due to bad storage and are unsuitable for broadcasting. In particular, the ATV version of the popular soap Crossroads is missing 2,850 episodes of its original 3,555. Also often largely lost are quiz shows; few editions exist of the 1970s version of Celebrity Squares with Bob Monkhouse, or Southern's children's quiz Runaround.[citation needed]"}

The official explanation was carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty stove, but the truer answer might be the folly of trying to simplify existence amid what was already so simple as to belong on a moon of Saturn. Survival required exactly the opposite strategy. It demanded complexity, sensory overload, a Victorian museum cluttered with bric-a-brac rather than a spare, wooden shack.

Benjamin gets a nice sax solo in the middle of this contemplative piece. This song, for whatever reason, stands out as a bit more lyric-driven. According to Benjamin, there is a loose “thread” that governs the lyrical themes on both City of the Sun and Contrapasso, having to do with a “‘utopian’ universe” – on the new album, things revolve around “false prophets” causing this perfect society to crumble by essentially attracting cult followings, and the “downfall and ‘resurrection’ of the city and its people.” This fits sensibly with the somewhat hopeful-sounding quality of ‘Serpentstone’, which is the last lyrical track on the album."}

And while HR 38 has now passed the House, a version of it will still have to contend with the Senate, which will need eight Democrats to support the measure for it to pass. While those prospects seem slim, if it were to pass the Senate, two things are certain: First, it’s all but guaranteed that President Trump will sign it into law. “Trump has been a strong supporter from the very beginning of the whole concept of concealed carry, even before he ran for president,” says Todd Rathner, a prominent gun rights lobbyists based in Arizona. “I don’t think he’d have any hesitations signing this.” The second is that lawsuits will be waiting. In a statement, Eric Tirschwell, director of litigation and national enforcement policy for Everytown for Gun Safety, said, “We fully expect that the Senate will hear the voices of law enforcement and the public, and stop this dangerous legislation from becoming law. But if it were to make it to the president’s desk, we’d be waiting on the other side fully prepared to challenge it in court.”"}

The first was that Gale was publicly intoxicated in the city of Washington on six specified dates during August, including August 31, two days after his arrest.[25] The second charge was of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. There were three specifications: first, that Gale had visited a house of prostitution near the Marine Barracks \"in open and disgraceful manner\" on that same August 31; second, that he had on September 1 - a date on which he was in custody - called Lieutenant Richard M. Desha, the Corps' Paymaster and son of Congressman Joseph Desha of Kentucky [19] - who had earlier charged Gale with misappropriation [25] - \"a damned rascal, liar and coward\" and threatening him with personal chastisement unless he would immediately challenge and fight him;[26] and, finally, that he had declared in front of the Marine Barracks \"that he did not care a damn for the President, Jesus Christ or God Almighty!\" The third charge was that Gale had signed a false certificate that said he had not used a Marine for personal services when in fact he had had a man assigned as waiter and coachman from October 17, 1819, until June 3, 1820. The fourth and final charge was that Gale had broken arrest \"at sundry times\" between September 1 and 8 while he was confined to quarters.[26]"}

Many churches and monasteries were closed and scores of clergymen were imprisoned or executed. The state propaganda machine vigorously promoted atheism and denounced religion as being an artifact of capitalist society. In 1937, Pope Pius XI decried the attacks on religion in the Soviet Union. By 1940, only a small number of churches remained open. It should be noted that the early anti-religious campaigns under Lenin were mostly directed at the Russian Orthodox Church, as it was a symbol of the czarist government. In the 1930s however, all faiths were targeted: minority Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism."}

{"text": "The question of what makes a woman beautiful is entangled with the subject of vowing in an interesting fashion. In chapter 9, the rabbis return to a subject they have addressed several times before: the grounds on which a vow can be legally annulled. There is some disagreement about how lenient the courts should be in finding such grounds. For instance, should a court “broach dissolution”—that is, suggest to the vow-taker that he annul the vow—on the basis of “the honor of his father and mother”? After all, a vow like the one involving spitting on a rabbi would presumably bring disgrace to the person who took it, and thereby shame his parents. Perhaps the court could suggest to the vow-taker, then, that if he had known that his vow would make his parents look bad, he would never have taken it? Rabbi Eliezer says yes, but the rabbis disagree: Parental honor and shame can be taken into account only if the vow directly affects one’s parents. It can’t be grounds for annulling vows in general."}

Aden has yet to be convicted of any crime, and he has denied any wrongdoing. Dibaba, who is a member of an accomplished distance running family, has never tested positive in her career. Still, given Aden’s arrest and the current environment in track and field, Dibaba’s presence in tonight’s race has rankled some people. This is yet another reminder of the ever-present specter of performance enhancing drugs in track and field, and in sports in general.” That told viewers a lot in 30 seconds. Costas will really be missed when he is gone."}

Again there was an effort to do so but it failed; appropriations were authorized. And there always remains the possibility of impeachment should a President act in disregard of Congress’ authority on these matters."}

{"text": "Pradeep Chatterjee (name changed), 32, a senior correspondent with a media company in Mumbai, had everything going for him-a job he liked, a decent salary, and a new two-bedroom flat in Borivali overlooking the school where his eight-year-old son studied. But earlier this month, there were rumours that his firm was laying off at least 300 people, including several in the online team he worked with. On August 23, Chatterjee's worst fears came true. The HR head handed him and 44 of his colleagues the pink slip, along with two months' salary. As Chatterjee got into a final emotional huddle with his other 'sacked' colleagues, he could no longer hold back the tears. \"I wouldn't have felt so devastated had I been thrown out for poor performance,\" he said.Chatterjee is just one among hundreds of media professionals who have lost their jobs over the last two months, and joins thousands across various sectors such as automobiles, infrastructure, banking, and engineering as India nosedives into a dangerous vortex of economic malaise. The proportion of Indian workers gainfully employed slipped to 35.4 per cent in 2011-12, compared to 36.5 per cent in 2009-10, the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) said in June. This is a sizeable fall from an employment rate of 42 per cent in 2004-05, when the UPA government came to power for the first time.Consultants say that if things keep moving in the direction they are, job losses across the country would touch 500,000 in 2013-14, similar to the levels at the time of the financial meltdown in 2008-09. India has lost five million jobs overall in the fiveyear period 2005-2010, the Planning Commission said in March this year, while only 2.76 million jobs were added. A hiring outlook survey by Naukri.com in July revealed a muted hiring sentiment for the remaining half of 2013 compared to what it was at the beginning of the year, with only 43 per cent of recruiters forecasting new job creation in the year's second half. \"The economy is certainly not in the best of shape,\" says Ambarish Raghuvanshi, CFO, Naukri.com, part of Info Edge India.\"The hiring confidence can't overlook these parameters and hence reflects the slowdown.\" The Manpower Employment Outlook Survey for the third quarter (July-September) for 2013 said employers in India reported the weakest hiring outlook in eight years in the Asia-Pacific region. An estimated 4.5 million enter the Indian job market every year-750,000 engineers, 500,000 MBAs and at least three million other graduates.\"Given an evident slowdown in manufacturing and exports, the employment outlook by companies certainly looks weak,\" says Naina Lal Kidwai, president, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), and country head, HSBC India. \"FICCI's Business Confidence Survey for the last quarter of financial year 2013 has reported bleak employment prospects vis-a-vis a year ago. A majority 65 per cent of the participants indicated no fresh hiring over the first two quarters of fiscal year (FY) 2013-14,\" she adds.The situation seems worse off than 2008, when Indian companies were relatively unaffected and proceeded with expansions and overseas acquisitions. \"The mood is unlikely to change, till the global and local macro economic issues play out,\" says Sonal Agrawal, CEO of Accord Group India, an executive search firm. \"The 2008 slowdown was a global phenomenon, with its roots in the US. But Western economies are now reviving,\" adds E. Balaji, an HR expert and former CEO of manpower consultancy Randstad India.That means the current crisis is a local creation in which India can hardly blame anyone else."}

Where we find few good intellectuals are within realms of inquiry which involve large amounts of data about how people think and act, and whose real-world applications aren’t immediately obvious at every step of the development of the science (for example, economics and linguistics). The former are important, sure, but the latter are crucial as well; one of the deepest problems of modern society is this lopsided character of common understanding. Humans have harnessed material nature with a terrifying level of ability, yet far too lacking is comprehension of fields such as group psychology and economics. Where humans can direct the forces of nature to powerful ends, but cannot control their own societal processes, catastrophe is near."}

{"text": "The simple answer is no, he is not. RJ Anderson wrote an excellent article on BP this week about why Peavy is a different hurler than the Peavy of yesteryear. Anderson brings up two very distinct points as to why this is a much different Peavy than the one we saw in the past. Anderson points out that Peavy is now locating a large percentage of his fastballs up and away to righties, and up and in to lefties. He attributes the high fastballs to the massive amount of fly balls Peavy has been giving up. He currently holds the lowest ground ball percentage (24.5%) among qualified starters in baseball. Peavy has never been a ground ball pitcher, but his current percentage is uncharacteristically low. Anderson notes that while this new approach to locating his fastballs a different look for Peavy it has been a very effective approach. Anderson also points out that Peavy's strikeouts aren't has high as they were in during his \"vintage\" period. Strikeout rates over nine were the norm for Peavy during the '04-'08 stretch, but his current K-rate is just under eight (7.88). Anderson is not trying to say that Peavy's current rate of 7.88 is low, just that \"vintage Peavy\" struck out a ton of batters, and the Peavy we've been seeing in 2012 is not going to do that."}

And the cost per unit of performance, or $ / Rel Perf, is the price of the chip at list price divided by this calculated relative performance. With this simple metric, we can compare the oomph and bang for the buck across the Xeons – albeit in a very rough way. We are working to get the full integer, floating point, and database performance metrics for these Xeon families, which Intel collects. This is just a beginning, not an end. And, as usual, such data as we are presenting is meant to give you a starting point from which to make your own application benchmarking decisions, not purchasing decisions.

{"text": "2. Taxes and borrowing don’t pay for government spending While governments do need to tax, MMT says that they do not do it to pay for their spending. Indeed, MMTers argue that government spending must come first. How can anyone pay a tax denominated in the government’s currency unless the government first spends it into the economy? So what are taxes for? We have already seen one function of tax in point 1. Taxes drive the nations currency. They also act to ‘make room’ for the governments spending, preventing that spending from generating inflation. Progressive taxes are also used for re distributive purposes to help a government meet it social aims, and taxes can also be effective to incentivise or disincentivise certain behaviours (e.g. smoking, drinking, polluting). But what about government borrowing? At the moment, if the amount of tax collected is less than the amount a government spends, it ‘borrows’ the rest by issuing government bonds. The amount it borrows is repaid with interest. MMT though, argues that similar to taxation, this borrowing is not undertaken to finance its spending, but to maintain its target interest rate. Under current arrangements, if a government didn’t match its spending to taxes plus borrowing, this would create excess reserves in the banking system, and this would drive overnight interest rates down to zero. Government borrowing also acts as a risk-free source of savings to the private sector, including pension funds."}

As the script originally called for a S&W Model 29 with a 4\" barrel, this eventually proved troublesome for the filmmakers, since the Model 29 was no longer in production at the time. Before shooting began, Eastwood contacted Bob Sauer (then a representative for Smith & Wesson) to acquire the gun for the film. It was a challenge, but Fred Miller at the plant had a couple assembled from parts eventually. To better familiarize himself with the weapon's handling and recoil, Eastwood took one to a gun range and fired live rounds through it. Unlike the gun in the script, the only barrels acquired for the guns in this film were the 8 3/8\" barrel and the 6 1/2\" barrel. Both can be seen used in some scenes. The blanks it fired were custom made since the 5-in-1 blank didn't fit the chambers.

{"text": "In real terms, the workers' standards of living tended to drop, rather than rise during the industrialization. Stalin's laws to \"tighten work discipline\" made the situation worse: e.g., a 1932 change to the RSFSR labor law code enabled firing workers who had been absent without a reason from the work place for just one day. Being fired accordingly meant losing \"the right to use ration and commodity cards\" as well as the \"loss of the right to use an apartment″ and even blacklisted for new employment which altogether meant a threat of starving.[2] Those measures, however, were not fully enforced, as managers were hard-pressed to replace these workers. In contrast, the 1938 legislation, which introduced labor books, followed by major revisions of the labor law, were enforced. For example, being absent or even 20 minutes late were grounds for becoming fired; managers who failed to enforce these laws faced criminal prosecution. Later, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, 26 June 1940 \"On the Transfer to the Eight-Hour Working Day, the Seven-day Work Week, and on the Prohibition of Unauthorized Departure by Laborers and Office Workers from Factories and Offices\"[3] replaced the 1938 revisions with obligatory criminal penalties for quitting a job (2–4 months imprisonment), for being late 20 minutes (6 months of probation and pay confiscation of 25 per cent), etc."}

{"text": "The \"Great Purge\" swept the Soviet Union in 1937. It was widely known as the \"Yezhovschina\", the \"Reign of Yezhov\". The rate of arrests was staggering. In the armed forces alone, 34,000 officers were purged including many at the higher ranks.[17] The entire Politburo and most of the Central Committee were purged, along with foreign communists who were living in the Soviet Union, and numerous intellectuals, bureaucrats, and factory managers. The total of people imprisoned or executed during the Yezhovschina numbered about two million.[18] By 1938, the mass purges were starting to disrupt the country's infrastructure, and Stalin began winding them down. Yezhov was gradually relieved of power. Yezhov was relieved of all powers in 1939, then tried and executed in 1940. His successor as head of the NKVD (from 1938 to 1945) was Lavrentiy Beria, a Georgian friend of Stalin's. Arrests and executions continued into 1952, although nothing on the scale of the Yezhovschina ever happened again."}

But one afternoon, while fumbling with gear in a McMurdo warehouse, I overheard an allusion to ‘the source regions’. The technicians used the term casually, discussing what goods would be shipped to a remote camp well over the Transantarctic Mountains. But in my mind the phrase sparked an epiphany of symbolism. The source regions. Here was the geographic place at which the East Antarctic ice sheets gathered and then flowed outward. Here was a place that took nothing from elsewhere save fugitive water vapour and turned it into Ice. I had come here to understand Antarctica, by whatever means I could. Surely that quest demanded a journey to the source, for it must certainly contain the essence of the Ice. So after a trip to the National Science Foundation chalet where I pleaded my case, and then a layover at the Pole, adapting to high elevation, I stepped off an LC-130 (‘The Antarctic Queen’) on a dazzling 1981 New Year’s Eve at Dome C and found myself at the end of the world."}

Inconsistent definitions of rape, different rates of reporting, recording, prosecution and conviction for rape create controversial statistical disparities, and leading to rape statistics which are unreliable, and do not represent the full picture. Even though Britain has, more male rape awareness campaigns and crisis centres available per head of the population than in most other Western countries, under British Law, the crime of male rape was only legally recognised in 1994. Unlike most countries, British society is beginning to open their minds, and recognise that men are also vulnerable, and men have hope through Male Rights activist groups. Yet, even Britain still has a long way to go with regards public awareness of male rape."}

The youthful conquests of King John the Presbyter (also called Prester John) united most of the human world into a single realm, but by the beginning of the first book, the former conqueror is too old and feeble to stop his sons from quarreling.

Its $138 million total in America may have been \"disappointing\", but the film grossed $242 million overseas giving the film a global total of $379 million, good for third-place in 1998. In 2005, the $375 million worldwide gross for the $150 million Batman Begins got us The Dark Knight. And the $396 million global gross for the $175 Snow White and the Huntsman counts has a franchise starter, with a sequel on the way."}

{"text": "Though most soap operas transitioned from live broadcast to videotaping their shows during the 1960s, it was still common practice to wipe and reuse the tapes. This practice was due to the high cost of videotape at the time. While soap operas began routinely saving their episodes between 1976 and 1979, several soaps have saved recordings of most or all their episodes. Days of Our Lives has recordings of all its episodes; its first two episodes exist on their original master tapes, and were aired by SOAPnet in 2005. The Young and the Restless, Dark Shadows and Ryan's Hope saved most of their episodes, despite the fact that they debuted during the 1960s and 1970s, before retaining tapes became common practice. Episodes of The Doctors began to be saved no later than December 4, 1967; this is where reruns of the series began when picked up by Retro Television Network in September 2014, and distributor SFM Entertainment claims to have roughly 95% of the series' episodes intact in its library.[18] Episodes of other soaps broadcast during the 1950s to 1970s do exist in different forms and have been showcased in various places online."}

Diana Furchgott-Roth: I don't have that number in front of me but I could find out and get back to you. Franken: I can tell you how many it was. It was zero. Do you know how many medical bankruptcies there were last year in France? DFR: I don't have that number for you but I can get back to you, if you like. Franken: Yeah, the number is zero. Do you know how many there were in Germany? DFR: From the trend of your questions, I'm assuming the answer is zero, but I don’t know the precise amount and I would have to get back to you.. Franken: Well you're very good. You're very ... fast. The point is I think we need to go in that direction not the opposite direction. Thank you.

But what happens when such people try to enter disciplines which demand a massive amount of data, experience, and wisdom regarding the nature of interpersonal interaction? At that point, intellectual hyper-focus and a hazardously high dedication of time is not enough. Sanity is hopeless, for their mind shall struggle to orient itself properly within social reality. Mathematics can be studied in a dark room with nothing but a pen and paper; psychology cannot.

{"text": "Given the extent of the social stigma towards male rape, and the level of patriarchy in society, it is understandable as to why so many male-male sex crimes are believed to go unreported. Even if the numbers are smaller – so what? Men are human beings, just like women; and no human being deserves such pain and suffering. Nor do men, as fellow human beings, deserve the psychological terror male rape victims experience of being judged, abandoned, ridiculed, and not to mention the fear or actuality of contracting HIV. In certain non-Western countries men are left with no access to healthcare or surgery, leaving them incontinent from their injuries, and unable seek help for fear of homosexual conviction. Many men end up doubting their sexuality, fearing sex, and many have difficulty forming relationships as a result of rape. Male rape can cause severe disability or disorder, and whilst the crime is undoubtedly a real threat for women, it is also so for men. It a heinous crime, no matter who the victim may be, and is not something to joke about, or judge a genuine victim for. Male rape victims need to know they have nothing to feel ashamed of – it is not their fault, and they need to be able to speak out."}

Royals of Amber who have negotiated the Pattern can travel freely through the shadows. By shifting between shadows, one can alter or create a new reality by choosing which elements of which shadows to keep, and which to subtract.

The media sometimes portrays Team Robbo as reckless hooligans or even as an unknown terrorist group, however the reality is that throughout the world, as with others in their community, they are astonishingly creative writers, artists, philosophers, clowns and poets and not at all the people that the conventional media world expects. Other well known graffiti writers who command substantial respect plus lesser known writers from around the world have now also begun to identify themselves with the crew and form a series of ‘satellite’ Team Robbo crews. The widespread grass roots support amongst street art and graffiti communities does at times result in a degree of visual anarchy, with the good, the bad and sometimes the ugly, being written in the name of Team Robbo. An international graffiti art movement is never going to be entirely cohesive, which is why this crew will always be more than just a brand - it’s a momentum. The artistic battle that has waged for over two years between Team Robbo and Team Banksy (now a popular way of describing his crew) on both the street and in the media is of course a tongue in cheek ‘war’; in some ways a pointless and absurd struggle, but with a serious sub-text. The ‘war’ has served the useful purpose of flushing out several pre-conceived ideas that surrounded street art and graffiti and has also provided a fresh public perspective, as well as fuelling a vociferous debate. There are still considerable layers of visual prejudice and hypocrisy that operate within the legal framework around graffiti. At least this has now been exposed for what it is. A bizarre situation has been maintained, where some writers are locked up for their creative work, whilst others (generally street artists), are celebrated by our culture and the media."}

{"text": "“Our consultant, Jonathan Dotan, went and pitched what our guys are doing to actual VCs,” Judge says. And the first one they approached said that he’d buy in. “They said it’s called a deep-tech investment.” The pitching process helped iron out a lot of the details that make the show work, Berg explains. “We asked people, ‘Would you invest in this company? If not, why not?’ We tried to push a real version of this company through the system up there, just to see if this would work. If not, why not? We were basically asking all the same questions about running this business that Richard is asking in the show, so a lot of the stories in the first season are stories that just came up. ‘Well, it’s called Pied Piper’–does he own the name? If somebody wrote him a check for $200,000 to Pied Piper, Incorporated, and he went to the bank to try to cash it, what would happen?’” Making the show’s central conceit–that Richard (Middleditch) and the product he’s created are worth potentially billions–work in the tech world is important. But part of figuring out how to make sure the show was engaging outside of that world was to also ensure that the product’s utility–it’s a new method for lossless data compression–was something that people could grasp. To that end, what Richard and his friends end up creating is something of universal utility, though not mass appeal. That’s something that Judge and Berg thought about a lot in this process. “I think The Social Network only worked as a movie because you know that Facebook is worth billions of dollars,” Berg says. “That’s what’s compelling–but if it were a fictionalized account of a company that may or may not become worth something, I think you just don’t give a shit.” In other words, making a show about a business-facing application, rather than a consumer one, took a lot of the pressure off. “This isn’t a social media app, where the audience at home would be like, ‘Well, I would never use that,’ because then it’s a lot less interesting,” Berg says. “This is just objectively useful, because everyone can understand that if you can take something that’s 5X, and make it X, then you can put it through a smaller pipe faster. Richard has figured out a way to do something better than anybody else, and that takes all of the guesswork out.”"}

{"text": "Conclusion The very first representatives of the currently living mammalian orders made their entry on earth at the end of Cretaceous. During Darwin’s descent with modification [3] many and diversified mammalian species developed. From ‘then’ until ‘now’ the differences in size and shape of mammalian species became spectacular. What happened to their hearts? Next to nothing. We conclude that the present mammalian heart is similar to that of their last common ancestor that appeared on earth, 125 million years ago. 2 In other words the heart was hardly if at all affected by the evolutionary adaptations that shaped all mammalian species. An important result of this study is the question as to what substrate is responsible for scaling of the AV conduction time in all mammals. Whether or not scaling in general is a product of natural selection is a debatable issue with no simple answer. However, the answer to the question as to what causes scaling of AV conduction time could be of importance for better understanding the effect of atrial fibrillation in humans on the rate and rhythm of the ventricles."}

He decided to wait at least 20 years before attempting to place it under state control and in the meantime concentrate on industrial development. However, after Stalin's rise to power, the timetable for collectivization was shortened to just five years. Demand for food intensified, especially in the USSR's primary grain producing regions, with new, forced approaches implemented. Upon joining kolkhozes (collective farms), peasants had to give up their private plots of land and property. Every harvest, Kolkhoz production was sold to the state for a low price set by the state itself. However, the natural progress of collectivization was slow, and the November 1929 Plenum of the Central Committee decided to accelerate collectivization through force. In any case, Russian peasant culture formed a bulwark of traditionalism that stood in the way of the Soviet state's goals."}

{"text": "As he proved in the Arizona Fall League after a very good year considering it was in the pitcher’s haven of Jupiter last full season, the Marlins may really have something in Austin Dean. Following a .268/.318/.366 year with the Hammerheads which led his team and placed 18th in the Florida State League and earned him a FSL All Star Game invite as well as an invite to the Arizona Fall League where he hit .323/.364/.452 and made his second All-Star game of the year, Dean comes to the Suns riding high. What he has to thank for his success is a balanced approach, including the ability to wait pitches out until they are finished breaking and a short quick line drive stroke, backed by a solid lower half. His solid and still improving plate vision makes him a pesky out to get. He gets in the mind of pitchers, frustrating them by trying not to do too much with pitches out of his reach but rather just foul them off, forcing pitchers to make mistakes. Dean’s swing isn’t one that’s going to warrant him a ton of long balls but rather a prototypical short line drive stroke (as proven by a career 18.66 LD% coming into this year) that has the ability to reach all fields. As proven by a 77/148 BB/K over the course of his first two full seasons in the minors, Dean also isn’t afraid to take a walk if he doesn’t get what he likes. His patience, swing and plus speed which includes a good first step out of the box and warranted him 18 steals last year make him a fantastic future leadoff or two slot candidate. Dean will be and, by way of a .306/.416/.472 through his first 20 games in AA which includes an OBP that is currently fifth in the Southern League and a SLG and BA which rank 15th making him one of if not the best all-around bat thus far, already has been a fun project to watch fill out."}

{"text": "In the Android team, we’re true believers in not over-engineering things at first, and letting the code naturally evolve to where it needs to be over-time, instead of prematurely adding abstractions on top of abstractions in an attempt to prepare ourselves for the unpredictable future. For this reason, we’ve chosen a flavor of MVP that would keep our abstraction levels to the bare minimum. At the code level, this means having a single interface to represent the View. All other components are concrete classes. You might be asking yourself, how come only the View gets an interface? Given our immediate needs, this was the only component that would actually benefit from such an interface, since we actually do have different concrete views that share the same interface. So, in our case, an interface here would allow us to reuse the Presenters. A few MVP implementations online propose setting up interfaces for all components (the M, the V and the P). Even though this works perfectly fine, we’d advocate against it at this early stage, since the added cost to the code’s readability and maintainability, especially when considering onboarding junior developers unfamiliar with MVP, outweighs the benefits of this interface-based programming approach."}

While the interception wasn’t really his fault as the receiver slipped, on the two fumbles he deserved more of the blame. While the line is mostly at fault for allowing the pressure, Griffin didn’t feel the pressure well and the ball wasn’t protected. The one fumble led to an easy Dallas TD that all but put the game away. These are the types of errors the Redskins didn’t make last year, and a big reason why they made it to the postseason."}

Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man’s eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. In the years that followed, he changed his last name to Symonette, made a career as a musician, started a radio station in Miami and then re-invented himself as Michael the Black Man, an anti-gay, anti-liberal preacher with a golden instinct for getting on TV at GOP events.

I’m sure several of the Democrats who are facing reelection in 2014 are nervous about how they will comport themselves during the speech if they are caught on camera. If the president sets himself up for an applause line on Obamacare, how will they handle it so that their reaction can’t be used against them in their campaigns back home? Will Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu applaud at all? Will Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) give the president a standing ovation? I assume Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) will show up, but it’s certain she will not maneuver to get an aisle seat so she can shake hands with the president as he makes his way to the podium.

{"text": "I've been struggling for some time with how I should best stand up for gender justice in my local church context. A few years ago I made a decision which has recently become known to those in leadership at my church. In light of that, I'm sharing this here so that my views and decisions can be known more widely among my brothers and sisters at Highland in the hope that we might make more progress in this area. I also share this here to promote reflection, discussion and even action among others struggling with similar issues in their own church contexts.To begin, I want to start with honoring those at Highland, and among the elders in particular, who disagree with me in calling for the full inclusion of women in our common life together. I am aware of those passages in the corpus of St. Paul that shape the consciences of many on this matter. I do not judge anyone for having their conscience so shaped. Nor do I claim to have the truth in this matter. I simply feel compelled to share with those in my church, as I already have to some in leadership, the vision of the Kingdom as I discern it to be manifest in the life, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.For those looking in on this, some background context about my church.Highland is a part of the Churches of Christ. Historically, the Churches of Christ have been sectarian and fundamentalist, but recent decades have seen changes in this regard among many of our congregations. Many of our churches are now ecumenical and grace-oriented in outlook. Historically, then, Churches of Christ have been patriarchal in practice. However, some churches are making progress on this front and my church, Highland, has been a part of this progress.About ten years ago Highland went through a discernment process that changed many of our patriarchal practices. I was a part of this, serving as the Chair of the Steering Committee who oversaw the process. After this time of discernment a variety of public worship roles were opened up to women. At Highland women--by themselves--can teach adult bible classes (in fact, my wife Jana teaches with me and is a better bible teacher than I am) and during our times of worship woman can lead prayers, read Scripture, welcome and call us to worship, and offer the communion meditation.These have been wonderful changes. The voices of women are heard every Sunday. In calling us to worship. In prayer. In the reading of Scripture. In welcoming us to the Table.My two sons are growing up hearing the voice of their mother from the pulpit on Sunday morning.For all this the Highland elders--the pastoral leaders of our church--are to be greatly commended. They endured and suffered much in making these changes.And yet, our progress on this front has been stalled leading me to make, as a matter of conscience, some decisions about my participation in the life of Highland. These decisions have, until recently, been private. But since I've now shared these decisions with our leadership I'd like to make a public record of them in the hope that Highland would reengage this conversation.As a part of Highland's discernment process regarding women's roles two roles were left off the table. First, we did not consider if a woman could preach. Second, we did not consider if a woman could be an elder of the church. These two roles--preaching and serving as an elder--were to remain in the hands of men as they represented more formal roles of \"leadership\" and \"authority.\" In short, women can do anything at Highland except these two things, preach and serve as an elder.Let me pause here to also register a disappointment in this regard. During our discernment process it was determined, and publicly stated by the elders, that women could lead the praise/singing time during our assemblies. And yet, while this role was formally opened up, to date no woman has been asked to lead our worship. This failure to move forward on something the elders publicly committed to has been most discouraging and disappointing.But to offer some clarifications. In many ways the roles where woman are--formally or functionally--excluded do have an egalitarian feel. Women sing on our praise team and sing solos. Our preacher can invite women up as a part of a sermon and allow them to share, though they have to be \"hosted\" onstage by the male preacher. Elders are often introduced as couples and the elder couples are often called onstage to pray over and minister to people. Highland recognizes that the wives of the elders are carrying as much of if not more of a pastoral burden given the gifts of the particular couple (i.e., some of the wives, and this is often publicly acknowledged, are better pastors than their husbands). Still, there are many times when only the male elders are called forward and in the elder meetings only the men make the decisions.I would also like to note that there are passionate egalitarians among our elders. These elders fight for gender justice within the larger group. So the elders don't speak with one voice on this issue. It's a live conversation among them.In short, while patriarchal norms still govern how we see the preaching ministry, worship leading and eldership the lines are blurry and the conversation about gender justice ongoing.Still, our progress on these fronts has stalled leading me to make some decisions that I've shared with the Highland leadership and now want to make public.Specifically, about two years ago I decided that I could only be a part of Highland if I took concrete measures to express my solidarity with my sisters in Christ. To express this solidarity I decided that I would no longer participate in any activity at Highland where woman were excluded. (Let me pause to thank Jamey Walters for inspiring me with this idea.) This would mean that I would decline all invitations to preach at Highland as well as any invitation to serve as an elder.Where women in our church are excluded I will stand in that same position.Let me rush to say this isn't as heroic or courageous as it might be sounding. I've not been invited to be an elder. I don't sing well enough to lead worship. So these are pretty easy commitments to keep. And I'm not invited all that much to preach. I might preach once every year or two.However, I have begun to decline preaching invitations. Because of this my commitment has now been made known to some of the Highland staff and eldership. I've let them know that I won't preach at Highland until we allow women to preach. I'm writing this make that decision more public.Let me also clarify that this is not a criticism of Highland's ministers and staff. The staff is wanting to move this conversation forward and has, in fact, tried to extend invitations to women to preach. So the sticking point isn't with the staff or ministers. At the end of the day this boils down to how Highland needs to rethink how power and authority are to be used in the Kingdom.It should not be so among us, these exercises of power. It should not be so.Let me end on a confessional note. We are all seeing through a glass darkly. One day, we will see Christ face to face.Until then, may God have mercy on us all.In the six years since I took this position with my church I've kept my promise. I've preached all over the world, but never for my own church, despite many invitations.Last year, our church began the process of installing new elders. There was a big push to have women among those nominated and included as new elders. Unfortunately, if put to a vote right now, the current eldership would not vote for the inclusion of women. A compromise was reached. Install a new group of elders now, bringing new voices and perspectives into the eldership discernment process, and have another elder installation in two years. Between now and then, we'd have a fuller conversation about whether to include women at that time.As a part of the current installation, I have been nominated and invited to be an elder. This has given me a choice.On the one hand, I could decline, keeping true to the stance I've taken, and see what transpires in two years. Maybe women will be included then, but maybe not.On the other hand, I can accept the offer to be a new voice in the room as we discuss the inclusion of women over the next two years.I was very hesitant to back away from my stance, so I sought the wisdom of my wife and the women in our accountability group. What would they have me do? Stand in solidarity with them on the outside, or go inside to add my voice to a process that might bring about change? They told me to go inside to be a part of the process. So that's what I've decided to do.I'll update this post, Lord willing, in 2020."}

{"text": "In Brady Shoemaker, we have a guy who must have done something drastic to someone within the organization to warrant the treatment he has received in his Marlins career because as of late, the organization has done everything possible to hold him back. It all started innocently enough for Shoemaker with a bout of bad luck. After being claimed off waivers by the Marlins in 2013 after he spent that entire season out of baseball, Shoemaker returned to the minors with a vengeance in 2014, hitting .274/.374/.433 in AA Jacksonville. That year, he either led or was a close second in nearly every major offensive category amongst full time Suns including HR (12), OBP (.374), OPS (.808), walks (67), BB/K (.74) and RBI (71). Amongst qualifiers who appeared in at least 100 Southern League games, Shoemaker’s .374 OBP ranked 10th and his .808 OPS ranked 12th. His accomplishments warranted him a well-deserved call-up to AAA in 2015. At the highest level he’s ever played at, a 27-year-old Shoemaker quickly became one of the Zephyrs top players. Heading into a game on May 24th, Shoemaker was hitting a robust .310/.393/.509 and looked to be the next man in line for a call-up and probably would have been when Giancarlo Stanton hit the season ending DL with a hand injury on June 27th, leaving the Marlins scrambling for outfielders. Moreoever, Shoemaker, who also plays first, would have been the best choice considering first baseman Justin Bour’s struggles against lefties beginning to come to fruition and the fact that Shoemaker’s mashing versus them which amounted to the tune of a .302/.402/.573 that year was also beginning to rear it’s beautiful head. However, May 24th is when Shoemaker’s run of rough luck began. In the Zephyrs’ game that night against El Paso, Shoemaker broke a pinkie finger, putting him on the shelf for the rest of May, the entire month of June and the beginning of July, causing him to miss his window and an opportunity to make his major league debut. Being the consummate professional that he is and being no stranger to missing time only to come back even better, Shoemaker returned on July 7th and although his second half was, quite understandably after breaking a finger in his dominant hand, wasn’t as good as his first half as he struggled to find gaps as regularly as he did before the injury, Shoemaker remained one of the Zephyrs’ key contributors. By season’s end, he was arguably their full-season MVP, ending 2015 with a .284/.359/.417 line. His .776 OPS ranked third on the team as did his .417 SLG, once again not just making him a candidate but rather the prime candidate to become Justin Bour’s platoon partner at first base in 2016 after Bour ended the year with a .221/.293/.279 against southpaws. Even after the signing of career reclamation project Chris Johnson to a major league contract, Shoemaker at the very least still seemed lined up to make the roster as the fifth outfielder, especially after he began his spring by hitting (), one of the best bats in camp. However, that didn’t stop the Marlins from inexplicably making Shoemaker part of the first round of spring cuts. He watched as Cole Gillespie earned the nod as the fifth outfielder and planned to make the trip back to New Orleans. But the hits didn’t stop coming there. At the end of spring training, Shoemaker wasn’t assigned to New Orleans. He was, once again for reasons lost on everyone who has followed his career of late, assigned all the way down to AA Jacksonville. It would seem as though frustration has understandably so finally gotten the best of the now 28-year-old who could be playing in the majors and definitely should be playing above AA as his season with the Suns has gotten off to just a .212 start. While there is no doubt that the power hitting, balanced approach hitter that Shoemaker is and as his OBP (.356) and SLG (.353) are already proving, he will (continue to) improve upon that line as the season progresses but whether he makes the majors with the Marlins or not seems to be very much up in the air. Simply put, the guy can’t catch a break and the organization doesn’t seem to be willing to help him along."}

I am not afraid of any of those teams. The AFC South has a strong Texans defense and a turnaround Colts offense. However, both will be beatable! The Titans and Jags… well let’s just say sit back and RELAX! The Bears first 4 games are Texans, Eagles, Cowboys, Lions. The Bears COULD be 4-0 after these games. I personally think they will find a way to blow it and go 2-2, but I will touch on that later. Yes the NFC North is still a tough division, but if the Bears can go . in division play, then playoffs here we come! Less dumb plays… (Or so I hope).

I am not going to get into the Cutler argument right now, but he is the best current option for the Bears. He is OK guys come on…. Gase knew this and said “alright let’s run the ball a lot, throw smart passes, and have Cutty scramble.” No longer did we see any screens to fat/slow Bennett, reverse handoffs to Alshon, or Cutler throwing into triple coverage.

John Fox has always had success in his second season with a team, and I think that his disciplined style of football gives the Bears a great chance. Also, GM Ryan Pace has added some great pieces to the team by signing the likes of Danny Trevathan and Jerrell Freeman to the defense; and Josh Sitton and Bobby Massie to the struggling offensive line. With adding talented players, Pace has managed to anger some fans with the departures of standouts Matt Forte, Martellus Bennett, and Robbie Gould. Forte is the only one I have a problem with releasing. He is for sure one of the best RB’s the Bears have ever had. I get he was getting up there in age, but to get rid of him because we have faith in a back who had an OK year last season scares me. Let us not forget the mistake the Bears made a few years ago by letting Thomas Jones go because they had all the faith in the world in a young Cedric Benson. TOTAL BEARS MOVE! I am so happy to see Martellus Bennett gone. He was a good TE, but way too much baggage came with him in the locker room. Robbie Gould will be missed, but HE MISSED TWO game winners that crushed any hopes of making the playoffs (you win those two games and then possibly take the last game vs Detroit at home a little more seriously making them 9-7). Yeah he did win key games for the Bears, but you have to look to the future. I am not saying the new kicker will be as great or is the future, but hopefully he doesn’t cost the Bears any games."}

But they also argue that the WPR “implements” or channels congressional authority under the Constitution. It may well be then that since we have determined that appellants lack standing to enforce the WPR there is nothing left of their constitutional claim. Assuming, however, that appellants’ constitutional claim should be considered separately, the same logic dictates they do not have standing to bring such a challenge. That is to say Congress has a broad range of legislative authority it can use to stop a President’s war making, see generally John C. Yoo, The Continuation of Politics by Other Means: The Original Understanding of War Powers, 84 CAL. L. REV. 167 (1996), and therefore under Raines congressmen may not challenge the President’s war-making powers in federal court."}

Faced with evidence in nature that contradicted a certain reading of the Bible, all of them decided that the only sensible response was to adjust how they read the Bible. In their view, nature clearly showed the way things were, so any discrepancy had to lie with one’s understanding of scripture.

High IPC and greater speed count for a lot, but unlike the old FX family, Ryzen’s single-threaded performance is high enough to truly slug it out with Kaby Lake. If, on the other hand, you primarily care about single-threaded performance and gaming, the 7700K is easily the better choice.

Als die Nazis ihren Griff nach der Macht festigten, wechselten ein Großteil der Rotfrontschläger und andere Verbrecher die Seiten und gingen zu den SA Sturmtruppen.

{"text": "Abstract Forty years ago, we started our quest for ‘The Holy Grail’ of understanding ventricular rate control and rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF). We therefore studied the morphology and function of a wide range of mammalian hearts. From mouse to whale, we found that all hearts show similar structural and functional characteristics. This suggests that the mammalian heart remained well conserved during evolution and in this aspect it differs from other organs and parts of the mammalian body. The archetype of the mammalian heart was apparently so successful that adaptation by natural selection (evolution) caused by varying habitat demands, as occurred in other organs and many other aspects of mammalian anatomy, bypassed the heart. The structure and function of the heart of placental mammals have thus been strikingly conserved throughout evolution. The changes in the mammalian heart that did take place were mostly adjustments (scaling), to compensate for variations in body size and shape. A remarkable scaling effect is, for instance, the difference in atrioventricular (AV) conduction time, which is vital for optimal cardiac function in all mammals, small and large. Scaling of AV conduction takes place in the AV node (AVN), but its substrate is unknown. This sheds new light on the vital role of the AVN in health and disease. The AVN is master and servant of the heart at the same time and is of salient importance for our understanding of supraventricular arrhythmias in humans, especially AF. In Information Technology a software infra-structure called ‘enterprise service bus’ (ESB) may provide understanding of the mammalian heart’s conservation during evolution. The ESB is quite unspecific (and thus general) when compared with the specialised components it has to support. For instance, one of the functions of an ESB is the routing of messages between system nodes. This routing is independent and unaware of the content of the messages. The function of the heart is likewise independent and unaware of the routing of blood (oxygen) and of the specialised components of the mammalian body it has to support. Conclusions Evolution seems to have bypassed the heart, which is in contrast to the sometimes similarly looking, but yet quite differently functioning of the other organs of the mammalian body.

They are said to have an IQ of 5000. According to the Guinness Book of World Records the highest IQ recorded was a measly 190, though that category was removed due to the idea that IQ tests don’t really tell you anything substantial. All the same, this pokémon is also said never to forget anything and it has powerful telekinetic and telepathic capabilities. I'm sure you have some bad memories of people who've done you wrong in the past. So now imagine if you could remember every single bad thing that was ever done to you and you have the power to do just about anything you want to the offender. What makes things worse is that humans mostly get by on their intelligence. There have been many stories out there where you find creatures that have been made to have human intelligence and it always ends up bad. So does it really sound like a good idea to have one that is smarter than humans? Adding on the fact that the pokémon could do a number of things to you just by thinking about it you have a creature that you would have no defense against should it turn hostile. If you consider it can read your thoughts you'd have to guard even what you think just to avoid getting it mad. Everyone has hostile thoughts every now and then so this is the pokémon you'd want to avoid more than any other."}

{"text": "The thing to note here, to both “sides” if you wish to use such divisive terminology, is that we have seen an abhorrent amount of “mods can only be uploaded on a pc, so its the pc crowd sabotaging consoles”, this is an assumption, and it divides us on the real topic at hand. We do not know who they are, or how they prefer to game, simply that they have access to a pc. The real issue at hand, is the amount of support that is being shown to those who are performing these acts; this is not a matter of “Lazy modders”, or “Lucky that someone did it for them”, or “more exposure”. This is a direct contradiction of blaming the modders in the fact, that by encouraging the unauthorized redistribution on an official channel, means that those who are afraid of such an action will hide their content from the public. Those who become fed up with such actions will cease modding all together.

{"text": "“School attendance is a responsibility that must be respected during the school year. You go on vacation when school is out,” wrote one person. “If you have children in school, you plan your life accordingly.” In England, father Stewart Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, booked the family trip a year in advance, when national education regulations allowed schools to grant up to 10 days of leave for family holidays in special circumstances. But on Sept. 1, 2013, the law changed, permitting principals to limit leave to “exceptional circumstances.” Under the new rules, the principals at his children’s schools determined a family holiday was not an exceptional circumstance and refused to authorize the leave for all three children. (The two principals were not available for comment.) Sutherland said he was unaware of the legislative change and figured that as long as he didn’t exceed 10 days he wasn’t breaking the rules. Plus, he was unable to get a refund on the £2,500 trip ($4,500). So off the family went to Greece. When they returned, the Sutherlands were hit with a £360 ($650) fine, issued by the council of Telford and Wrekin, located about 250 kilometres northwest of London. Left unpaid, the fine doubled. Sutherland said he tried to explain his family’s situation to the local council but was told there was no appeal process and that he would have to make his case in court. The fine remained unpaid; the parents were charged and prosecuted under the Education Act 1996 for failing to ensure their children attended school regularly. The Star asked the Ontario Ministry of Education about the law governing school attendance and was told it was preparing a response. Last week, Stewart and Natasha Sutherland pleaded guilty in court. Griffin, the council spokesperson, said the fact that the legislation changed is a moot point. “They had made the request for the leave to be authorized and it had been refused,” he said. The Sutherlands were ordered to pay a £630 ($1,138) fine, plus £300 ($542) in legal costs and a £63 ($114) victim surcharge. That amounts to £993, or $1,794. Sutherland said he’s heard from “thousands” of other parents in similar situations. “The overwhelming support is unbelievable,” said Sutherland. “I’ve had people up and down the country trying to pay my fine.” He said he hasn’t accepted any money and urged people to donate funds to Scotty’s Little Soldiers, a charity that supports children of those killed serving the British Armed Forces. “People who don’t live in the real world, who work 9 to 5, five days a week, never work a weekend, and have never missed Christmas with the children, don’t have to work nights. Those are the only people against me.”"}

Rather than reply literally, they could think literally, and then reply socially. Describing social dynamics in a very literal way will often cause people to accuse you of autism, since they pattern-match such communication with people who have no other choice but to think that way. Who would model social reality with literal language, when such an affair is normally extremely slow and error prone in comparison to simply going with the flow of natural subconscious thinking? Well, when you lack the hardware to do the natural subconscious thinking, you take the second-best option, which is to use manual thinking to figure out what to do."}

{"text": "Functional Similarity of the Mammalian Heart Mammalian species live and survive in widely differing habitats, for example polar bears on the North Pole ice and camels in the desert. Despite varying demands on the circulation under those circumstances, their hearts are similar and show identical or nearly identical electrical and mechanical (haemodynamic) behaviour. The Electrical Function of the Mammalian Heart All contractions of atria and ventricles are preceded by their electrical activation. These activations (P and QRS) are linked by a varying time interval. This interval variation depends on heart mass or body mass and controls the optimisation of cardiac output under all circumstances. Figure shows a schematic representation of the electrical activation and the conduction pathways of the human (mammalian) heart [28]. The PR or PQ interval, AV delay or conduction time consists of three components: Conduction of the electrical impulse through the atrial myocardium from the sinoatrial node (SN) to the atrioventricular node (AVN) Conduction through the AVN proper and Conduction from the AVN through the His bundles, its branches and the Purkinje fibres (HP system) to the ventricular myocardium. Open in a separate window The conduction velocity of the electrical impulse through the HP system is high (in the order of 2–4 m/sec) when compared with the conduction velocity through the atria and the AVN [29]. Although never measured it can be expected that, on the basis of the electrical cable theory, in large mammals (horses, elephants, whales) conduction velocity in the HP system is higher (in any case not lower) than in mammals of smaller dimensions. Nevertheless it will be clear that in small to middle sized hearts (mice to dogs) the HP system, at this high conduction velocity, hardly contributes to the duration of AV delay, while in large hearts the contribution of the HP system to AV delay, depending on its length, can be substantial and is in all probability constant and therefore does not contribute to AV delay changes. It follows that in all mammals, small and large, the variation in AV delay (PR interval) is caused exclusively by the AVN proper. In fact this delay variation in the AVN is indeed one of the major survival strategies of all mammalian species. In other words the AVN warrants optimal cardiac output according to heart mass and continuous varying heart rates. We can assert that our multifunctional mammalian AVN is master and servant of the heart at the same time [8]. In the context of this paper, the adjustment of AV delay to heart mass (body mass) (scaling) deserves special attention. Scaling of AV Conduction Time/Delay In 1638 Galileo was the first to draw attention to the relationship between body size (mass/weight)1 and the dimension of bones in a variety of mammalian species [30]. In our time we call this relationship scaling. In biology, ‘Scaling deals with the structural and functional consequences of changes in size or scale among otherwise similar organisms’. [31] Scaling in cardiology includes the relation between heart mass (HM) and body mass (BM) HM = HM 0 BM1 [31]. Thus heart mass is proportional to body mass. In all mammals, including humans, heart mass is 0.6% of body mass [32]. There are also relations between heart mass and stroke volume (SV), SV = SV 0 HM1 and heart rate HR = HR 0 M0.25 so that cardiac output (CO), the product of HR and SV, is CO = CO 0 M0.25. In contrast blood pressure in the arterial system and diastolic and systolic pressures in the atria and ventricles are the same in all mammals and therefore do not relate to body mass, i.e. their scaling factors are zero (M0). Also all mammals, independent of body mass, have the same haemoglobin concentration, and the same oxygen capacity of blood as well as similar sized red cells. [33] In 1927, Clark was the first to notice the different durations of the PR interval (AV conduction time) in animals of different sizes [34]. Clark asserted that: ‘the PR interval on the ECG varies so little in different animals’. We later called this the ‘mismatch’ between size and function of the heart [9]. The PR intervals in mammals indeed vary, for instance, from about 40 ms in mice to about 400 ms in elephants and in the whales we studied [35, 36]. Figure illustrates the dependence of PR interval on body mass in a number of mammalian species. The PR interval in small mammals is generally longer and in large mammals shorter than expected from the body mass values. The deviation in small mammals (smaller than cats) is due to the fact that: ‘A certain minimum time is needed for a heart to contract, expel blood, relax and be filled again, ready for the next contraction’ [31]. The deviation in large mammals (larger than horses) is at least partly due to slower than expected heart rates. These lower heart rates are caused by a diminishing specific metabolic rate (metabolic rate per kg body mass, MBR), with body mass which decreases with increasing body size; the regression line having a slope of −0.25 [31], MBR = MBR 0 M−0 [25]. It turns out that the fourth root line shows an almost perfect fit as already described by Noujaim et al. in 2004 [37]. Figure shows the large difference in conduction velocity in the hearts of a mouse and a whale, almost by a factor 100. The contribution of the AVN to the total AV delay is large (even almost total) in small mammals and relatively limited, though as vital, in large mammals [38]. This scaling of conduction velocities is caused by size dependent conduction properties of the AVN. In all mammalian hearts scaling of AV conduction time follows ‘the universal law for simple allometric scaling to ensure an optimal atrioventricular activation sequence’ [37]. The mechanism responsible for this scaling, the morphological and molecular substrate, respectively, is unknown. Open in a separate window Open in a separate window Scaling of the PR interval occurs in mammals of different species but also in differently sized mammals of one and the same species [39], small versus large (dogs, chimpanzees, horses) and in humans (babies, children, adults) [39–41]. Whether or not scaling is a product of natural selection is a debatable issue with no simple answer. We question if scaling of the PR interval relation to heart mass or body mass in different mammalian species is an expression of evolutionary adaptation. Perhaps it is simply (?) a matter of adjustment to size without adaptation by natural selection. We tend to conclude that differences in AV conduction time between mammals have not been caused by the genetic differences between species but that they follow the universal law for allometric scaling. The Haemodynamic Function of the Mammalian Heart The mammalian heart is a suction-pressure pump made of muscle. Heart mass and stroke volume have a scaling factor of 1. Haemodynamic parameters of the heart with respect to pressures in heart chambers and arteries (blood pressure) are, as far as it has been studied, of the same order of magnitude in all mammalian species. Since maintaining laminar flow depends on the pressure differences between two sites of a conduit, A and B, the flow velocity of arterial blood is, in comparable blood vessels (e.g., aorta, capillaries), also similar in all mammals. The adjustment (scaling) of AV conduction velocity compensates for size differences, resulting in the strong similarity and optimal haemodynamic function of the heart."}

Or, more generally, it seems clear that there’s a higher incidence of autism-like personality qualities in communities like Less Wrong than in, say, sports-based communities. The reason, I think, is that autism-spectrum neurological differences involve difficulty with automatic modeling of social dynamics. While most people optimize fluidly and efficiently for, say, speaking in a normal way, it might not come naturally to an autistic person to perceive the nuanced and subtle responses from other people which are supposed to act as fine-grained social feedback that leads the speaker on a smooth trial-and-error path toward a kind of delivery that’s pleasant to listen to rather than grating or annoying. That is, people who have autism-spectrum-like symptoms but are otherwise intelligent will learn how to think manually and literally, since subconscious optimization for social reality doesn’t come naturally to them. They didn’t choice to become Analytical Thinkers; rather they simply didn’t have the hardware that makes standard social optimization a normal subconscious affair; all that’s left, then, is thinking in terms of literal cause-and-effect mechanisms."}

{"text": "Artists as thoroughly divisive as SOPHIE don't come around often, so when they do it's worthwhile to analyze where the disconnects are. Of course, the actual music is always a factor, and SOPHIE's singles to date have ranged from effusive to unprecedented to befuddling , depending on who you ask. But the deepest rifts have been more conceptual than specific, with questions and critiques on the merits of underground dance music that's so unabashedly silly, bright and enamored with pop and EDM tropes. Are SOPHIE's tracks meant to subvert self-serious dance floors? Or dupe reactionary listeners? And what to make of an independent producer whose work seems prepackaged for commercial viability In a community that values history and transparency, SOPHIE is a disruption, an ideological deviant with dubious intentions. Where you land on the matter is seen as a statement of allegiance, marking your tastes as old-school, progressive or—gasp!—ahistorical.arrives three years into this, and effectively caps off a formative era. Compiling two previous Numbers singles with four unreleased tracks, the collection, complete with its flashy packaging and merchandise , confirms any position you'd like it to.When SOPHIE debuted on Huntleys + Palmers in 2013, the single came with a quote from the artist: \"I try to make music which is fun to dance to—that should be the loudest voice talking. I think it would be extremely exciting if music could take you on the same sort of high-thrill three-minute ride as a theme park roller coaster.\" You couldn't find a more uncomplicated expression of what good club music can do, andaccomplishes it precisely. \"Vyzee\" is the producer at his catchiest, a bit of nonsensical, bubblegum rave that hits like QT's older sister. It's also the most straightforward track here, with 4/4 kicks and a verse-chorus structure, and finds SOPHIE making fantastic use of that space. Closer \"Just Like We Never Said Goodbye,\" a beatless, stadium-sized ballad for adrenaline junkies and star children, also tweaks his sound to great effect. SOPHIE only swings off course by misjudging his eccentricities. \"MSMSMSM\" is aggro trap served right down the middle, and strange as \"L.O.V.E.\" is, its jagged club deconstructions have little bearing on’s compass. Still, for a couple of stylistic outliers, those tunes deliver their own thrills.'s tracklist is arranged chronologically, but \"Bipp\" is no less the perfect introduction. Let the central vocal hook sink in: \"I can make you feel better, if you let me!\" Here's a glimpse behind the SOPHIE curtain. He tells us exactly what the next 25 minutes are meant to do, and only asks that we let our guard down. Without the cultural rhetoric and the over-the-top marketing and the conspiracy theories and the mainstream attention in the mix,is simply forward-thinking, flawlessly-produced electronic music that wants no more than to slap a grin on the dance floor. Like \"Vyzee\" flirtatiously suggests, \"We can go crazy in the club, if that's what you want to do.\""}

Her objective is to find the truth behind a conviction whose evidence was scarce and which put a teen-ager in prison for life. Last year, Koenig was contacted by a woman named Rabia Chaudry, who had read some articles that Koenig had written years ago in the Baltimore Sun, about a defense attorney who was disbarred in 2001 and who later died. That attorney had represented Chaudry’s friend Adnan Syed, who in 1999 was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. Chaudry, who has always believed Syed to be innocent, thought that the attorney had mishandled the case—perhaps even thrown it—and asked Koenig to take a look. She agreed, and that turned into the investigation that became “Serial.”"}

Intel’s comparisons ranged from the “Ivy Bridge” Xeon E5 v2 processors through the current Skylake Xeon SPs, which are the result of the convergence of the Xeon E5 line for workhorse two-socket and four-socket systems and the Xeon E7 big memory machines that have four or more sockets. We tend to think of the “Nehalem” Xeon 5500 processors as the foundation of the modern Xeon business, since they are so architecturally different from the Xeons that preceded them (and very much resembled the Opteron processors from rival AMD at the time the Nehalem chips were launched in March 2009).

{"text": "In this conversation, food carbon footprint often arises. However, the most carbon intensive portion of food production and consumption, outside of driving to the store and putting the food in your refrigerator, is the farming methods. The amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere varies widely with regard to the manner in which the food is grown. Because the manufacture of chemical fertilizers and other conventional farming inputs are reliant upon vast amounts of fossil fuel, the food you eat (local or not) can account for huge levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) releases. According to a recent New York Times article about Tropicana orange juice, fertilizers alone contribute to nearly 60% of the CO2 emitted in production. Conventional chemical-based agriculture is a net emitter of CO2 and by some estimates contributes between 9 - 20% of our total greenhouse gases in the U.S."}

And lots of more liberal commentators, including Paul Krugman at The Times, are pointing out that the coverage of the Clinton Foundation is a little fast and loose with phrases like “casts a cloud” or “raises questions” and this sort of innuendo, but there isn’t actually much there there. And then you can actually point to real moments of corruption and pay to play and bribery and all these things in Donald Trump’s past, so I just wondered, Nate, what you think about the impulse to scrutinize both candidates, but also whether you think there’s an emerging “got to hit both sides” impulse in the media."}

It was a monumental task to write tests around Activities that contained all logic to perform data parsing, formatting, network calls, error handling, and the management of their own lifecycle. Just thinking of how to write a test under these conditions was enough to make us look the other way. As soon as we converted our first piece of code into MVP, writing tests around it became trivial. With a clear contract of what a view is able to handle, we were able to distance ourselves from the intricacies of the Android UI framework, and just test that the correct methods were actually being called, given each test scenario. The actual business-related logic now lives inside the Presenters, and since most of them have no knowledge of the Android OS (or the little knowledge they do have can be mocked), we’re able to write very efficient unit tests around them as well. As a result, we increased our test cases from around 10 to over 900, and growing, in just the past few months."}

Representatives from 300 school districts, students, teachers, parents, and others marched and called on Perry to use the state’s “rainy day fund” to cover the shortfall in schools rather than lay off a projected 189,000 education workers. The officially nonpartisan rally was distinctly anti-Perry with chants of “it’s raining, it’s pouring, but Rick Perry’s snoring” and slogans like “Flunk Perry” plentiful and to be seen everywhere. The publicity surrounding the event provoked a press release from the Koch Brothers funded conservative activist group Americans for Prosperity that had been funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into all states where unions were strong: destroying the public education system in Wisconsin and Indiana, and attacking union rights in Iowa and elsewhere."}

The offering would ostensibly allow poor kids in failing schools to transfer to and pay for private schools. But Romney didn't explain a hole many have identified: the program would only offer families about $3,000 per child, but private school tuition costs well over $7,000 on average -- a cost that would continue to price out extremely poor families."}

{"text": "I am 30 years old and have been fapping since I was 12 I think(don't honestly remember when I started). I did it at least 4 to 5 times a week, some days I would do it 3 to 4 times. I have always been a very passive guy mostly because I was always afraid somebody would find out how much I was fapping and judge me.I have been married for 5 years now and that mentality had carried over into my marriage. I was still hiding that I was fapping to porn and would even lie about it because I was so worried about how she would react rather that just telling the truth. I have 2 daughters now, one is almost 4 and the other is 6 months old. I realized with my children and my wife that I needed to try and stop to see what it was like with out fapping and porn. I can honestly say that it is the most incredible feeling to not be hiding anything from my wife(I know that hiding fapping and porn may seem stupid but that was how I was raised, we didn't talk about anything that made us uncomfortable).I have been doing this for a couple of months now and it has been one of the hardest things to do mainly because it was something I did for so long. I used to be a smoker way back when and I was able to just stop and walk away from it. I thought that would be how this was going to be but it was far from. My mood was pretty bad for a little while there but it is getting better. You see, I am a stay at home dad and live in a small town where I have only one or two friends. So when I took on this challenge, I was in a tough sitiuation to do it. But, thankfully, I remembered how good working out made me feel about myself and it has been my saving grace.I wanted to post here to let everybody know that it can take over your life if you let it. Fapping feels great but for what? 8 seconds of pleasure? Take it from a very happy married man now, it is not worth it for the pleasure. Get the pleasure from a wonderful women that can make all your dreams come true and make you feel like you are king of the mountain, not your hand. I just hope that this story may help some of you realize that not fapping is more than just giving you energy, it gives you a mountain of self confidence in yourself.It is hard, but if the great things in life were easy, everybody would be happily married, rich, and not fap, haha!!Just some extra motivation, \"Find your place in the world, don't let the world find it's place in you\""}

However, during his testimony, Henderson was forced to admit that his knowledge of Gale's misconduct was based on hearsay. Miller could similarly not provide firsthand evidence of wrongdoing by Gale.[21] After the court of inquiry exonerated him of these charges for the second time, Gale, with 21 years of service and therefore senior, became Lieutenant Colonel Commandant on March 3, 1819,[22] ending a six-month period during which the Corps had been leaderless.[17]"}

In this case, it’s about creation both on a divine and a more intimate human scale, and it once again links the violence that humans do to one another in intimate family situations with how they violate and destroy the planet on which they live, which needs care and tending rather than trampling and exploitation."}

{"text": "Where not to start: Long before finding fame with The Prestige, Christopher Priest wrote the 1976 novel The Space Machine, an H.G. Wells homage that juxtaposed Victorian England and the surface of Mars. It remains a fun yet overlooked bit of early steampunk. That said, it isn’t a strong example of what the subgenre can do—unlike K.W. Jeter’s 1987 book Infernal Devices, a Victorian-Era romp full of clockwork androids (which, along with airships, are an essential steampunk trope) that winds up feeling too flimsy and whimsical, in spite of its on-the-nose steampunk-isms. The same can be said of Paul Di Filippo’s The Steampunk Trilogy. The trio of novellas seems, from name alone, to be the perfect introduction to the subgenre, but its saucy, pun-laced tone is best savored after digesting some of steampunk’s more substantial fare. Now that steampunk has become a subcultural touchstone—even Thomas Pynchon worked elements of it into his 2006 novel, Against The Day—a new crop of writers has latched onto its wonderfully clunky retro-futurism. But regardless of whether the new steampunk breed is good (such as Jay Lake’s sprawling, metaphysical Mainspring from 2007) or not-so-good (like S.M. Peters’ by-the-numbers Whitechapel Gods from 2008), such new entries are best reserved for readers who already have a solid grip on steampunk’s fundamentals."}

{"text": "So that’s a different way you could put it: the difference between life and non-life is the difference between chemistry and biochemistry. But that’s tautological. What makes biochemistry different from chemistry is that it has history in it, and that history is written in the bits that were deposited through Darwinian evolution. If you think of it that way, it’s a good signpost to guide one’s thinking and for people to challenge each other’s ideas."}

{"text": "In the United States, the major broadcast networks also engaged in the practice of wiping recordings until the late 1970s. Many episodes were erased, especially daytime and late-night programming such as daytime soap operas and game shows. The daytime shows, almost all of them having been taped, were erased because it was believed at the time that nobody would ever want to see them again after their first broadcast. However, the success of cable television networks devoted to reruns of these genres proved that this was not the case, as the large number of episodes that were required for a daily program made even a short-run game show an ideal candidate for syndication. By this time, however, the damage had already been done."}
{"text": "There are four steps to mindfulness meditation: First, close your eyes but keep them focused on the spot between your eyebrows near the top of your nose. Second, place your hands palms up on your thighs or palms down in your lap. Third, pay attention to your breath, saying to yourself \"rising\" and \"falling\" with each inhalation and exhalation. Fourth, Be aware as you breathe in and out, and mentally note the thoughts, feelings, sounds, tastes, smells, and physical sensations (such as itching, pain or discomfort, or feelings of heaviness and lightness) you experience. Don't analyze any of what you're noting. Simply be present, open, alert, and watchful as you allow the witnessing mind to emerge."}

An application developer can create an application that works both within GNOME and within Unity, but we’re adding extra barriers to the task of creating an application for Linux. That’s already far too hard."}
