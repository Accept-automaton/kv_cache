{"text": " White Dog is a \" blunt , highly cinematic parable about race relations \" that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior , or if it is an untreatable disease . The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism , with his radically contrasting moments of innocent , typical dog behavior when not around black persons , and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target . Paul Winfield 's character Keys , who believes he can help the dog unlearn this behavior , represents the view that racism can be unlearned . Keys ' attempts to reprogram the dog become a \" bold literalization of the race war \" , and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog . Much like Captain Ahab , he declares that if he fails with this dog , he will find another and another until he succeeds . Keys ' counterpart , Carruthers , a white trainer , believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed , representing the view that racism cannot be cured . \n"}

{"text": " Burgess shale type preservation is defined as the fossilization of non @-@ biomineralized organisms as flattened carbonaceous films in marine shales . When the animals started to decompose , their tissues collapsed under the weight of the sediment that buried them . The typical flattened fossils are outlines of tougher parts such as cuticles and jaws , which resisted decomposition for long enough to be fossilized . Soft elements , such as muscles and gut contents , were sometimes squeezed out of the decomposing organism to produce dark stains on the fossils . Organisms that lack tougher structures , such as flatworms , nemerteans and shell @-@ less molluscs , were not preserved by this process . Very soft but chemically active tissues may be preserved by different processes . For instance during decomposition , bacteria modify the chemically unusual mid @-@ gut glands of some organisms into the durable mineral phosphate . This change happens extremely quickly , before the corpse is compressed , and leaves a three @-@ dimensional mold of the tissues . Gills can also be preserved in something close to their original three @-@ dimensional shape by this process . Both preservation mechanisms can appear in the same fossil . In Burgess @-@ like shales , organisms and parts that are only quite soft , such as muscles , are generally lost , while those that are extremely soft and those that are fairly tough are preserved . The preservation of different body parts in different ways may sometimes help palaeontologists , by suggesting whether a body part was fairly tough like an arthropod limb ( preserved as flat film ) or very soft and chemically active , like a part of the gut ( preserved as a solid piece of mineral ) . These differences may also help to identify fossils , by excluding from consideration organisms whose body parts do not match the combination of types of preservation found in a particular fossil bed . \n"}

The Linear B scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel , while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces . According to the records in the palace of Pylos , every rural community ( the damos ) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army ; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy . \n"}

The local settlers resented Bradburn 's efforts to withhold land titles from those who had squatted in unauthorized areas . They were further angered by his attempts to enforce customs laws which had been largely ignored . The hard feelings escalated when Bradburn , following Mexican law , refused to return runaway slaves to their owners in the United States . After receiving a hoax letter claiming that armed men were marching on Anahuac to retrieve runaway slaves , Bradburn arrested local lawyers William Barret Travis , Patrick Churchill Jack . Settlers were outraged that Travis did not receive some of the protections offered by the United States Bill of Rights , even though these rights were not guaranteed in Mexico . A large force of Texians marched on Anahuac to secure Travis 's release . The resulting confrontation forced Bradburn 's expulsion from Texas and encouraged other immigrants to take armed action against Mexican soldiers . As a result of his actions , Bradburn was \" one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of \" Texas in the 19th century . \n"}

{"text": " Mitochondria ( and related structures ) are found in all eukaryotes ( except one — the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp . ) . Although commonly depicted as bean @-@ like structures they form a highly dynamic network in the majority of cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion . Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type . A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms . Conversely , numerous mitochondria are found in human liver cells , with about 1000 – 2000 mitochondria per cell , making up 1 / 5 of the cell volume . The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential , with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions , leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes . The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum . Often , they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton . The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape , which can affect the function as well : different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical , chemical , and signalling advantages or disadvantages . Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum . Recent evidence suggests that vimentin , one of the components of the cytoskeleton , is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton . \n"}

{"text": " Keats realized that he could never have Love , could not fulfil his Ambition , and could not spend his time with Poesy . The conclusion of \" Ode to Indolence \" is a dismissal of both the images and his poetry as figures that would only mislead him . Even indolence itself seems unattainable ; Andrew Motion writes that the figures force Keats to regard indolence as \" the privilege of the leisured class to which he did not belong . \" If the poem is read as the final poem in the 1819 ode series , \" Ode on Indolence \" suggests that Keats is resigned to giving up his career as a poet because poetry cannot give him the immortality he wanted from it . Ironically , the poem provided Keats with such immortality . Besides the biographical component , the poem also describes Keats 's belief that his works should capture the beauty of art while acknowledging the harshness of life . In this way , the poems as a group capture Keats 's philosophy of negative capability , the concept of living with unreconciled contradictory views , by trying to reconcile Keats 's desire to write poetry and his inability to do so by abandoning poetry altogether and accepting life as it is . \n"}

{"text": " Diamond is the allotrope of carbon in which the carbon atoms are arranged in the specific type of cubic lattice called diamond cubic . Diamond is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque . Owing to its strong covalent bonding , diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known . Yet , due to important structural weaknesses , diamond 's toughness is only fair to good . The precise tensile strength of diamond is unknown , however strength up to 60 GPa has been observed , and it could be as high as 90 – 225 GPa depending on the crystal orientation . The anisotropy of diamond hardness is carefully considered during diamond cutting . Diamond has a high refractive index ( 2 @.@ 417 ) and moderate dispersion ( 0 @.@ 044 ) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance . Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present .

Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors .

Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success , the national party , with an ex @-@ Republican Union general at the head of the ticket , faced more opposition . The party 's courtship of black voters , too , threatened the white Democratic establishment , leading to violent outbursts at Weaver 's rallies and threats against his supporters . As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October , Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states . Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors , in state @-@ level races , Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates . In the September gubernatorial race in Maine , one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted , who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party . The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign , and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt . \n"}

The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudor — a relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts . They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford . Although later legitimised by Richard II , Henry IV had formally and permanently debarred them from the succession to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster ’ s claims to the throne . By some calculations of primogeniture , there were as many as 18 people — including both his mother and future wife — with more right to the throne . By 1510 , this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants . \n"}

Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August . It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space , and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines . Nevertheless , it was taken into discussions with the Dutch , where the 11 July design was merged with it .

{"text": " If Philip had been a Christian during his military service , he would have not been a particularly unusual figure for his era — although membership in the army was prohibited by certain churchmen , and would have required participation in rites some Christians found sacrilegious , it was not uncommon among the Christian laity . The position of an emperor , however , was more explicitly pagan — emperors were expected to officiate over public rites and lead the religious ceremonies of the army . Christian scripture contains explicit prohibitions on this sort of behavior , such as the First Commandment : \" You shall have no other gods before me \" . Whatever the prohibitions , people raised on the \" more tolerant Christianity of the camp \" would have been able to justify participation in pagan ritual to themselves . We know that these people exist : the historical record includes Christian army officers , who would have been regularly guilty of idolatry , and the military martyrs of the late 3rd century . Their ritual sacrifice excluded them from certain parts of the Christian community ( ecclesiastical writers tended to ignore them , for example ) but these people nonetheless believed themselves to be Christian and were recognized by others as Christians . \n"}

Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances , many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum .

It would have been more natural for such a prose writer to have emerged a few centuries later , into an era of Romanian humanism . Born much earlier , Creangă showed up where there exists an ancient tradition , and therefore a species of erudition , ... in a mountain village ... where the people is unmixed and keeping [ with tradition ] . \" Outlining his own theory about the aspects of \" national specificity \" in Romanian letters , he expanded on these thoughts , listing Creangă and Eminescu as \" core Romanians \" who illustrated a \" primordial note \" , complemented by the \" southern \" and \" Balkan \" group of Caragiale and others . Claiming that the \" core \" presence had \" not primitive , but ancient \" origins , perpetuated by \" stereotyped wisdom \" and \" energetic fatalism \" , he asserted : \" Creangă shows our civilization 's contemporaneity with the world 's oldest civilizations , our Asian age . \" The alternating national and regional characteristics in Creangă 's writings are related by historian Neagu Djuvara with the writer 's place of birth , an affluent village in an isolated region , contrasting heavily with the 19th century Wallachian countryside : \" if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account , one finds himself in a different country . \" Ornea , who noted that Eminescu effectively shared Creangă 's worldview , believed the latter to have been dominated by nostalgia for a world of independent landowning peasants , and argued that Creangă 's literary and political outlook were both essentially conservative . Ornea commented : \" One could say that it was through [ this form of nostalgia ] that the writer debuted and that , within the space of his work it became , in its own right , an expression of the world that was about to vanish . \" Commenting on Creangă 's \" robust realism \" and lack of \" sentimentality \" , Vianu contrarily asserted : \" Creangă 's nostalgia ... has an individual , not social , sense . \" \n"}

In the fall , males will follow females for prolonged periods of time . Occasionally , a second male will attempt to displace the first , and the whales will race each other at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . This often causes the racing whales to breach , which is rare in blue whales . This racing behavior may even escalate to physical violence between the males . Scientists have observed this behavior in multiple parts of the world , including the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada and the South Taranaki Bight in New Zealand . \n"}

Bower notes this scene as \" particularly important for establishing the cultural distance \" between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes .

{"text": " After the assassination in mid @-@ 1584 of William the Silent , the leader of the Dutch revolt against Spain , English military intervention in the Low Countries was agreed in the Treaties of Nonsuch of 1585 . The murder of William the Silent also reinforced fears for Queen Elizabeth 's safety . Walsingham helped create the Bond of Association , the signatories of which promised to hunt down and kill anyone who conspired against Elizabeth . The Act for the Surety of the Queen 's Person , passed by Parliament in March 1585 , set up a legal process for trying any claimant to the throne implicated in plots against the Queen . The following month Mary , Queen of Scots , was placed in the strict custody of Sir Amias Paulet , a friend of Walsingham . At Christmas , she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley . Walsingham instructed Paulet to open , read and pass to Mary unsealed any letters that she received , and to block any potential route for clandestine correspondence . In a successful attempt to entrap her , Walsingham arranged a single exception : a covert means for Mary 's letters to be smuggled in and out of Chartley in a beer keg . Mary was misled into thinking these secret letters were secure , while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham 's agents . In July 1586 , Anthony Babington wrote to Mary about an impending plot to free her and kill Elizabeth . Mary 's reply was clearly encouraging and sanctioned Babington 's plans . Walsingham had Babington and his associates rounded up ; fourteen were executed in September 1586 . In October , Mary was put on trial under the Act for the Surety of the Queen 's Person in front of 36 commissioners , including Walsingham . \n"}

{"text": " Depending on breed , sheep show a range of heights and weights . Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding . Ewes typically weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms ( 99 and 220 lb ) , and rams between 45 and 160 kilograms ( 99 and 353 lb ) . When all deciduous teeth have erupted , the sheep has 20 teeth . Mature sheep have 32 teeth . As with other ruminants , the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard , toothless pad in the upper jaw . These are used to pick off vegetation , then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed .

{"text": " In 1911 another Royal Commission investigation into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility . Its report was ignored by the state government , which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools , rather than the plight of its prisoners . However , there was a rapid change in prison policy , with the appointment of a superintendent , Hugh Hann , who had recent English and colonial experience , and the election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform . One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912 . It shares with Katingal Special Security Unit in New South Wales the record for brevity of use of a permanent Australian penal structure . \n"}

{"text": " The city 's fortifications were strong , with a wide moat and a thick wall protected by 44 towers , according to the contemporary geographer Ibn Khordadbeh . The caliph assigned each of his generals to a stretch of the walls . Both besiegers and besieged had many siege engines , and for three days both sides exchanged missile fire while Arab sappers tried to undermine the walls . According to Arab accounts , an Arab prisoner who had converted to Christianity defected back to the caliph , and informed him about a place in the wall which had been badly damaged by heavy rainfall and only hastily and superficially repaired due to the city commander 's negligence . As a result , the Arabs concentrated their efforts on this section . The defenders tried to protect the wall by hanging wooden beams to absorb the shock of the siege engines , but they splintered , and after two days a breach was made . Immediately Aetios realized that the defence was compromised , and decided to try and break through the besieging army during the night and link up with Theophilos . He sent two messengers to the emperor , but both were captured by the Arabs and brought before the caliph . Both agreed to convert to Islam , and Mu 'tasim , after giving them a rich reward , paraded them around the city walls in full view of Aetios and his troops . To prevent any sortie , the Arabs stepped up their vigilance , maintaining constant cavalry patrols even during the night . \n"}

{"text": " In response to the unfalsifiability criticism of evolutionary theory , numerous examples of potential ways to falsify evolution have been proposed . J. B. S. Haldane , when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution , replied \" fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era . \" Numerous other potential ways to falsify evolution have also been proposed . For example , the fact that humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes than the great apes offered a testable hypothesis involving the fusion or splitting of chromosomes from a common ancestor . The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that human chromosome 2 is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other primates . Extra , inactive telomeres and centromeres remain on human chromosome 2 as a result of the fusion . The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of DNA sequencing methods . If true , human DNA should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes , than to other mammals . If not , then common descent is falsified . DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA ( between 95 % to 99 @.@ 4 % depending on the measure ) . Also , the evolution of chimpanzees and humans from a common ancestor predicts a ( geologically ) recent common ancestor . Numerous transitional fossils have since been found . Hence , human evolution has passed several falsifiable tests . \n"}

Generally , a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect . LP shunting provides long @-@ term relief in about half the cases ; others require revision of the shunt , often on more than one occasion — usually due to shunt obstruction . If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions , a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered .

In 1824 Classical scholar Antoine @-@ Jean Letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion 's use . Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ .

François Salvolini , Champollion 's former student and assistant , died in 1838 , and this analysis and other missing drafts were found among his papers . This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini 's own publication on the stone , published in 1837 , was plagiarism . Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it , which appeared in 1841 .

Sigourney Weaver , who played Ripley in Alien , had doubts about the project , but after meeting Cameron she expressed interest in revisiting her character . 20th Century Fox , however , refused to sign a contract with Weaver over a payment dispute and asked Cameron to write a story excluding Ripley . He refused on the grounds that Fox had indicated that Weaver had signed on when he began writing the script . With Cameron 's persistence , Fox signed the contract and Weaver obtained a salary of $ 1 million , a sum 30 times what she was paid for the first film ( and equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 in present @-@ day terms ) . Weaver nicknamed her role in the Alien sequel \" Rambolina \" , referring to John Rambo of the Rambo series , and stated that she approached the role as akin to the titular role in Henry V or women warriors in Chinese classical literature . \n"}
{"text": " Ultimately , it was Newton 's friend , editor and publisher , Edmond Halley , who , in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets , used Newton 's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits . This calculation enabled him , after examining historical records , to determine that the orbital elements of a second comet that had appeared in 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets that had appeared in 1531 ( observed by Petrus Apianus ) and 1607 ( observed by Johannes Kepler ) . Halley thus concluded that all three comets were , in fact , the same object returning every 76 years , a period that has since been amended to every 75 – 76 years . After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets , he predicted its return for 1758 . \n"}

It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish ; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks , allowing the meat to breathe , while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car . After the Civil War , J. B Sutherland , John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars , which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool . This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods . Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car , which preserved foods even better . For much of the 19th century , the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines , which was a problem when the ice was continually melting ; by the 1860s , refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process . \n"}

The French struggled to move troops through the mountain passes from the Moulouya Valley due to heavy snows and attacks on their columns , and Lyautey , to his embarrassment , was forced to request reinforcements from Algeria . By October the situation had stabilised to the extent that Poeymirau was able to withdraw his troops to Meknes , but a large @-@ scale uprising in January 1919 forced his return . Poeymirau defeated n 'Ifrutant in battle at Meski on 15 January , but was seriously wounded in the chest by the accidental explosion of an artillery shell and was forced to hand command to Colonel Antoine Huré . Lyautey then received assistance from Thami El Glaoui , a tribal leader who Lyautey had made Pasha of Marrakesh after the uprising of 1912 . El Glaoui owed his increasing wealth ( when he died in 1956 he was one of the richest men in the world ) to corruption and fraud , which the French tolerated in return for his support . Thus committed to Lyautey 's cause , El Glaoui led an army of 10 @,@ 000 men , the largest Moroccan tribal force ever seen , across the Atlas to defeat anti @-@ French tribesmen in the Dadès Gorges and to reinforce the garrison at Boudenib on 29 January .

{"text": " Aristotle and Pliny relate the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king , the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest . Initially , it looked as though the eagle would win easily , but as he began to tire , a small bird which had hidden under the eagle 's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title . Following from this legend , in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \" king of the birds \" or as a flame bearer . However , these terms were also applied to the Regulus species , the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles , and , because of the legend 's reference to the \" smallest of birds \" becoming king , the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren . The confusion was assisted by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Ancient Greek words for the wren ( βασιλεύς basileus , \" king \" ) and the crests ( βασιλισκος basiliskos , \" kinglet \" ) . In English , the association between the firecrest and Eurasian wren was reinforced by the kinglet 's old name of \" fire @-@ crested wren \" . \n"}

{"text": " Hogan 's obituary stated that , at some point in his playing career , he set a record for baserunning . Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895 , when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13 @.@ 2 seconds . The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906 , for instance , reported that Hogan \" lowered the base @-@ running record \" in 1895 , noting that \" [ t ] he distance around the bases is 120 yards \" . In January 1906 , Sporting Life reported that Hogan had \" taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him \" . The report added , \" Under proper conditions [ Hogan ] turned the route in 13 1 – 5 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895 \" . Some observers questioned the veracity of the record , however . In 1907 , for instance , Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that \" Hogan was a great sprinter \" but described his unofficial record as \" out of reason \" . Grillo , who argued that \" the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark \" , lent his support to an official record of 14 @.@ 1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement . An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan 's baserunning record . In this case , however , the writer claimed that the most \" authentic \" record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s . The article stated that , while Hogan was \" said to have beaten Berthrong 's base @-@ circling record of 13 2 – 5 seconds by a fifth of a second \" , this alleged feat was not \" performed under official sanction \" . One year earlier , in 1906 , Berthrong , himself , weighed in on the debate . According to an article that appeared in Sporting Life in March of that year , Berthrong disputed Hogan 's claim . \" My time ... around the bases was made in Washington , D.C. , in July 1868 , after the old Nationals of Washington , D.C. , had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore , Md . \" , Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview . \" Three stop watches were held over me , the slowest giving me 14 1 / 4 \" . The retired player added : \" I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1 @-@ 5 : nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it , and I doubt if he could \" . For reasons that are unclear , the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889 , six earlier than other reports . ( A similar description of Hogan 's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life ; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record \" in Indianapolis in the 80 's \" . ) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan 's contested record to 1898 ; he speculated that Ben Morgan , an official of the National Association , \" disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records \" . The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson , who rounded the bases in 13 @.@ 4 seconds in 1929 . Despite questions surrounding Hogan 's baserunning record , he became popularly known as the \" Indianapolis Ringer \" . Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre @-@ game competitions . On August 2 , 1895 , the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had \" a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who , it is claimed , can get down to first quicker than Hogan \" . The article added , \" A race between the two is talked of \" . Then , on August 17 , 1895 , the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest . \" The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card \" , the article added . \" Indianapolis goes around the land , and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game . He has not yet been defeated \" . Several days earlier , the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life , who reportedly commented : \" Mart Hogan , the Indianapolis outfielder , is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap \" . \n"}

{"text": " The building now used as the White Spring Temple was originally a Victorian @-@ built well house , erected by the local water board in 1872 .

However , after building the reservoir , the water board soon discovered that the high calciferous content of the water caused pipes to block and by the end of the 19th century water was piped into Glastonbury from out of town .

{"text": " In prepubertal girls , the functional squamocolumnar junction is present just within the endocervical canal . Upon entering puberty , due to hormonal influence , and during pregnancy , the columnar epithelium extends outwards over the ectocervix as the cervix everts . Hence , this also causes the squamocolumnar junction to move outwards onto the vaginal portion of the cervix , where it is exposed to the acidic vaginal environment . The exposed columnar epithelium can undergo physiological metaplasia and change to tougher metaplastic squamous epithelium in days or weeks , which when mature is very similar to the original squamous epithelium . The new squamocolumnar junction is therefore internal to the original squamocolumnar junction , and the zone of unstable epithelium between the two junctions is called the transformation zone of the cervix .

{"text": " Scream was a turning point in terms of casting for the horror genre , which normally involved relatively unknown actors . The genre was considered unsuitable for bigger names as the films had lower budgets and often attained negative critical response . Drew Barrymore read the script and was interested in being involved . She approached the production team herself to request a role . Barrymore , a member of the Barrymore family of actors and granddaughter of actor John Barrymore , had become a star in her own right following her appearance in E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial ( 1982 ) . The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest , and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott . Her involvement was believed to be instrumental in attracting other popular actors to the film in spite of its smaller budget , and in causing Craven to reconsider his decision to direct the film . Before filming began , Barrymore was faced with unexpected commitments that meant she would no longer be available to play the demanding lead role . She instead played the smaller role of Casey Becker , which allowed her to remain involved and still gave the production the advantage of her stature . Killing off one of their biggest stars early in the film was considered a calculated risk , but it was believed that it would be so shocking and unexpected that the audience would then believe that any character could die . Actresses including Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead role of Sidney ; the producers also approached Reese Witherspoon , though she never auditioned . Craven had seen Neve Campbell in the TV show Party of Five and asked her to audition for the part . He believed she could portray a character who was \" innocent \" , but who could also realistically handle herself while dealing with the physical conflict and emotions required by the role . Campbell was initially reluctant to perform in another horror film so soon after her supporting role in The Craft . After a successful audition , Campbell accepted an offer to play the lead character . She accepted because Scream would be her first leading role , and because she adored the character , saying \" She 's a fantastic character for any kind of movie . \" \n"}

The Court rejected the argument that police questioning on board a bus constitutes a per se seizure under the Fourth Amendment , and instead held that courts should use a \" totality of the circumstances \" test to determine whether a passenger would have felt \" free to decline the officers ' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter \" , or whether a passenger was free \" to ignore the police presence and go about his business \" .

The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey ' Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002 ' , which found that the Scottish public would prefer the majority of their electricity to come from renewables , and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy . A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74 % of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs . When people were asked the same question in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010 , 78 % agreed . The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005 . The 2010 survey also showed that 52 % disagreed with the statement that wind farms are \" ugly and a blot on the landscape \" . 59 % agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant . Regarding tourism , query responders consider power pylons , cell phone towers , quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms .

{"text": " The fishing industry on Dal Lake is the second largest industry in the region and is central to many of the people 's livelihoods who reside on the lake 's periphery . Dal lake 's commercial fisheries are particularly reliant on carp fish species , which were introduced into the lake in 1957 . As a result , carp constitutes 70 % of all the fish caught in the lake while the schizothonax constitutes 20 % and other species account for 10 % . Fishermen use a locally manufactured cast net which comprises six parts with a diameter of 6 metres . It is operated from a wooden fishing boat made out of deodar , typically 20ftx4ft in size . The gradual decline in quality of the lake water through pollution has resulted in lower fish stocks and the extinction of endemic varieties of fish . The causes for such deterioration have been identified and remedial actions have been initiated.The various fishing nets being used in Dal Lake are cast net ( Zaal / Duph ) , Long line ( Walruz ) , Gill net ( Pachi , Shaitan zaal ) , Rod and line ( Bislai ) , Scoop net ( Attha zaal ) ( Bhat et al . , 2008 ) \n"}

Design chief Albert D 'Agostino — another long @-@ termer , who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941 — and art director Walter Keller , along with others in the department , such as art directors Carroll Clark and Jack Okey and set decorator Darrell Silvera , are similarly credited . The studio 's 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars : Robert Mitchum ( who graduated to major star status ) and Robert Ryan each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO . Gloria Grahame , Jane Greer , and Lawrence Tierney were also notable studio players in the field . Freelancer George Raft starred in two noir hits : Johnny Angel ( 1945 ) and Nocturne ( 1946 ) . Tourneur , Musuraca , Mitchum , and Greer , along with D 'Agostino 's design group , joined to make the A @-@ budgeted Out of the Past ( 1947 ) , now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs .

Before the match , Barnes wagered £ 8 at 15 / 1 on himself to score a century , and trained especially diligently in the lead @-@ up to the Lord 's fixture . He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match , and the refusal of the authorities at Lord 's to allow him to practise there when he was in London a year earlier ; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub . On the first morning , Bradman won the toss and elected to bat , and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test . The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden . The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over , caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg . Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early , mishitting the ball to Hutton , and leaving Australia at 1 / 3 . They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day . \n"}

However , based on its physical similarity to the kestrels and the established nature of the name American kestrel , there has been little impetus to change its name . This could change in the future if continued genetic research more precisely determines the evolutionary history of the American kestrel within the genus falco . The entire genus is actually a set of species so closely related that most or all can be hybridized by artificial insemination . Significant natural hybridization of species has occurred in the past during the evolution of this closely related set of species , such that precise evolutionary genetic analysis as to which species are more basal to other species or to the genus as a whole is difficult to render . \n"}

{"text": " The onefin electric ray was described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 , in the 13th edition of Systema Naturae . Gmelin 's name for the species was printed as Raja capensis in some copies of the book , and as Raja rapensis in others . The original spelling was probably rapensis , which modern taxonomists regard as a typesetting error as the etymology of capensis ( \" of the Cape [ of Good Hope ] \" ) is far more reasonable . Later sources have consistently used capensis , though to officially fix the specific epithet under that spelling would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) . Gmelin did not refer to any type specimens . In 1826 , German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup created the new genus Narke for this species , separating it from the other electric rays known at the time on the basis of its curved back and single dorsal fin . Later , more species were assigned to Narke . \n"}

{"text": " Negotiations over the fate of the ships were under way at the Paris Peace Conference . The French and Italians each wanted a quarter of the ships . The British wanted them destroyed , since they knew that any redistribution would be detrimental to the proportional advantage in numbers they had compared to other navies . Under Article XXXI of the Armistice the Germans were not permitted to destroy their ships . Both Admirals Beatty and Madden had approved plans to seize the German ships in case scuttling was attempted ; Admirals Keyes and Leveson recommended that the ships be seized anyway and the crews interned ashore at Nigg Island , but their suggestions were not taken up . Their concern was not without justification , for as early as January 1919 , von Reuter mentioned the possibility of scuttling the fleet to his chief of staff . Having learned of the possible terms of the Treaty of Versailles in May 1919 , he began to prepare detailed plans to scuttle his ships . Admiral Erich Raeder later wrote that von Reuter was informed that the fleet was to be scuttled at all costs . A further reduction of crews with the departure of two transports to Germany on 18 June 1919 meant that von Reuter was left with reliable men to carry out preparations . On that day he sent out orders , paragraph 11 of which stated : \" It is my intention to sink the ships only if the enemy should attempt to obtain possession of them without the assent of our government . Should our government agree in the peace to terms to the surrender of the ships , then the ships will be handed over , to the lasting disgrace of those who have placed us in this position . \" His orders were sent to the interned ships on 18 June . \n"}

{"text": " Since the origins of the modern private equity industry in 1946 , there have been four major epochs marked by three boom and bust cycles . The early history of private equity — from 1946 through 1981 — was characterized by relatively small volumes of private equity investment , rudimentary firm organizations and limited awareness of and familiarity with the private equity industry . The first boom and bust cycle , from 1982 through 1993 , was characterized by the dramatic surge in leveraged buyout activity financed by junk bonds and culminating in the massive buyout of RJR Nabisco before the near collapse of the leveraged buyout industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The second boom and bust cycle ( from 1992 through 2002 ) emerged from the ashes of the savings and loan crisis , the insider trading scandals , the real estate market collapse and the recession of the early 1990s . This period saw the emergence of more institutionalized private equity firms , ultimately culminating in the massive Dot @-@ com bubble in 1999 and 2000 . The third boom and bust cycle ( from 2003 through 2007 ) came in the wake of the collapse of the Dot @-@ com bubble — leveraged buyouts reach unparalleled size and the institutionalization of private equity firms is exemplified by the Blackstone Group 's 2007 initial public offering . \n"}

{"text": " Trujillo and colleagues have placed upper limits in Sedna 's surface composition of 60 % for methane ice and 70 % for water ice . The presence of methane further supports the existence of tholins on Sedna 's surface , because they are produced by irradiation of methane .

From these observations , they suggested the following model of the surface : 24 % Triton @-@ type tholins , 7 % amorphous carbon , 10 % nitrogen , 26 % methanol , and 33 % methane . The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid @-@ infrared photometry . The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that , at least for a short time , Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere . During a 200 @-@ year period near perihelion , the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed 35 @.@ 6 K ( − 237 @.@ 6 ° C ) , the transition temperature between alpha @-@ phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton .

However , its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface , and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna 's surface is ancient , rather than freshly deposited . This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow , which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto . \n"}

Though the theory required control of monetary policy , a federal responsibility , it became increasingly popular among former UFA supporters who , following Aberhart 's instructions , began to form local social credit \" study groups \" . Brownlee argued against social credit on the basis that its application by a provincial government would be unconstitutional and that it would do nothing to create markets for Alberta 's unsold wheat , which he viewed as the source of Alberta 's woes . The legislature held a series of hearings to investigate the theory , and both Aberhart and C. H. Douglas , the theory 's originator , testified at them . Brownlee questioned both on how the introduction of \" credit certificates \" issued by the Alberta government could help people so heavily dependent on interprovincial and international trade ; neither answered the question to his satisfaction . \n"}

{"text": " The reflexogenic pathway activates the parasympathetic nervous system in response to the sensation of touch . It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord ( not to the brain ) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2 – S4 . A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 may not be able to experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication , but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured . Likewise , although a man 's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher @-@ level SCI , he may still be able to get a reflex or \" spontaneous \" erection . These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed , e.g. by clothing , but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed . Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI , due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man . Conversely , an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections . People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a bulbocavernosus reflex ( contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or glans penis ) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication . Like other reflexes , reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock . \n"}

{"text": " Tropical Storm Jerry was a tropical storm that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast United States in August of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season . Jerry , the tenth tropical storm of the season , formed from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast in early August , which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the Bahamas and Florida later in the month , before striking Florida in the latter part of the month . Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall . The rainfall it produced , amounting to over 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in several locations across Florida , Georgia , and South Carolina , was responsible for $ 40 million ( 2005 USD ) in damage and 6 deaths . At the time , Jerry was the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record , until Jose in the 2005 season overtook it . Tropical Storm Jerry was also the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . \n"}

{"text": " The saxaul sparrow was first described by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 instalment of The Birds of Asia , from a specimen collected near Kyzylorda , now in southern Kazakhstan , by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov . Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as Passer ammodendri for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists . When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection , Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London . Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873 , and some later writers preferred to attribute him , but Gould 's description takes priority over Severtzov 's . The saxaul sparrow 's species name refers to its desert habitat , coming from the name of the Ammodendron or sand acacia tree , which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek άμμος ( ammos , \" sand \" ) and δένδρον ( dendron , \" tree \" ) . The English name saxaul sparrow refers to the saxaul plant , with which it is closely associated .

Second , bacteria can suppress the inflammatory response ; without this response to infection phagocytes cannot respond adequately . Third , some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of phagocytes to travel to the site of infection by interfering with chemotaxis . Fourth , some bacteria can avoid contact with phagocytes by tricking the immune system into \" thinking \" that the bacteria are \" self \" .

The organization and stability of the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment . Developmental psychologists interested in the individual 's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes . The organisation of mental working models is more stable while the individual 's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more . Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models . Instead , on one level they have a set of rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general . On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events . Information at different levels need not be consistent . Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships . \n"}

{"text": " The flaw in Dalton 's theory was corrected in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro . Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases , at equal temperature and pressure , contain equal numbers of molecules ( in other words , the mass of a gas 's particles does not affect the volume that it occupies ) . Avogadro 's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted . For instance : since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor ( at constant pressure and temperature ) , it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water . Thus , Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements , and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms . \n"}

The first is this , that under the Australian constitution the great common law courts of Australia are the Supreme Courts of the States .

It is to these Courts that he must come for a writ of habeas corpus . These Courts and their prestige must , therefore , at all costs be sustained so that they will continue to attract the finest characters and best legal brains that we can produce . As a community we will pay heavily if we allow our Supreme Court to be relegated to a position of inferiority . The second matter I feel I should mention is that the principle of the independence of the judiciary from the executive is fundamental to our freedom . What happens when this principle is departed from is evident from what is going on in many lands today . We must see to it that our citizens all understand that an independent judiciary is the greatest bulwark of their liberties and their best protection from totalitarian rule . \n"}

The material was then refined over several days , and after arrangements were agreed upon , the group quickly finished recording the songs , often in just one or two takes . Each song was recorded in a live take of guitar and drums before overdubs were added . This was done to give the music what Auerbach called \" that human element , that live feel \" . Similarly , the group eschewed playing to a click track , despite a tendency to speed up during choruses , to keep a natural feel in the performance . \" Dead and Gone \" was the first song to be completed . \n"}

Opera houses first wanted to omit Suor Angelica , which had proven the least popular of the three , but some wished to omit Il tabarro as well . Puccini had left London confident that Il trittico would gain a place in the Covent Garden repertoire , but soon learned that the opera house 's director , Henry V. Higgins , had removed Suor Angelica , feeling that the audience disliked it . In fact , Higgins would never stage it again . Puccini vociferously objected , as did his longtime London friend , Sybil Seligman , to no avail . Higgins then decided to remove Il tabarro , and stage Gianni Schicchi together with a Russian ballet presentation . Puccini retorted , \" This is a real betrayal \" , but in the end gave in and permitted the performance . Puccini , however , was still convinced that the three works should be performed together , and that his original conception was being \" brutally torn to pieces \" . The Metropolitan Opera joined in the dismemberment : after 1920 , it would not again present the three operas together until 1975 . \n"}

Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic . At the end of the Ramayana , a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices , after Sita 's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects . \n"}

A violinist friend of Handel 's , Matthew Dubourg , was in Dublin as the Lord Lieutenant 's bandmaster ; he would look after the tour 's orchestral requirements . Whether Handel originally intended to perform Messiah in Dublin is uncertain ; he did not inform Jennens of any such plan , for the latter wrote to Holdsworth on 2 December 1741 : \" ... it was some mortification to me to hear that instead of performing Messiah here he has gone into Ireland with it . \" After arriving in Dublin on 18 November 1741 , Handel arranged a subscription series of six concerts , to be held between December 1741 and February 1742 at the Great Music Hall , Fishamble Street . These concerts were so popular that a second series was quickly arranged ; Messiah figured in neither series . \n"}

Taking all these developments in consideration , Rochussen concluded that the meeting in De Harmonie should be considered subversive and a danger to the state ; he let it be known that armed troops were ready to take control of the situation if need be . At 6 PM on 22 May , people were flocking to the club house , and by 7 PM it was packed . Van Hoëvell was quickly proclaimed to be president of the assembly . Soon after , though , the meeting became unruly and the shouts of a few led to a riot . In an increasingly unruly atmosphere , the protestors ousted van Hoëvell from his presidency as quickly as they had raised him to the position , after which he and others left the building .

It was spotted by Henry Wheatley , a coal porter who was driving his cart past Barnes Railway Bridge shortly before seven in the morning . He initially thought that the box might contain the proceeds of a burglary . He recovered the box and opened it , finding that it contained what looked like body parts wrapped in brown paper . The discovery was immediately reported to the police and the remains were examined by a doctor , who found that they consisted of the trunk ( minus entrails ) and legs ( minus one foot ) of a woman . The head was missing and was later assumed to have been thrown into the river separately by Webster . Around the same time , a human foot and ankle were found in Twickenham . It was clear that all of the remains belonged to the same corpse , but there was nothing to connect them with Thomas and no means to identify the remains . The doctor who examined the body parts erroneously attributed them to \" a young person with very dark hair \" . An inquest on 10 – 11 March resulted in an open verdict on the cause of death , and the unidentified remains were laid to rest in Barnes Cemetery on 19 March .

{"text": " In this species of slug , the radula is 8 mm ( 5 / 16 in ) long and 2 mm ( 1 / 16 in ) wide , and has 240 slightly curved transverse ( crosswise ) rows of denticles ( tiny teeth ) . Each row of teeth is composed of one median tooth and 10 lateral and marginal teeth on each side . The median teeth are small , and are clearly unicuspid ( having one cusp ) , though they are slightly shouldered . The lateral teeth are bicuspid ( having two cusps ) but the admedian ( next to the middle ) teeth are noticeably larger than the median row , and the mesocone ( an extra protrusion in the middle of the tooth ) is well developed . There is however , no distinction between the lateral and marginal series except that the ectocone ( extra little side protrusion ) present on the admedian teeth recedes in position and slightly diminishes in size in the succeeding teeth up to about the twentieth row on the radula , but in the marginal series , the ectocone gradually grows in size and importance as the margin is approached , while the mesocone becomes almost correspondingly diminished , the outermost teeth showing a more embryonic ( more like that of an embryo ) character . \n"}

{"text": " Some late medieval figures noted that the celestial spheres ' physical order was inverse to their order on the spiritual plane , where God was at the center and the Earth at the periphery . Near the beginning of the fourteenth century Dante , in the Paradiso of his Divine Comedy , described God as a light at the center of the cosmos . Here the poet ascends beyond physical existence to the Empyrean Heaven , where he comes face to face with God himself and is granted understanding of both divine and human nature . Later in the century , the illuminator of Nicole Oresme 's Le livre du Ciel et du Monde , a translation of and commentary on Aristotle 's De caelo produced for Oresme 's patron , King Charles V , employed the same motif . He drew the spheres in the conventional order , with the Moon closest to the Earth and the stars highest , but the spheres were concave upwards , centered on God , rather than concave downwards , centered on the Earth . Below this figure Oresme quotes the Psalms that \" The heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork . \" \n"}

{"text": " There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose 's burial place , or if it was a cenotaph . Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly were unable to locate any internal chambers , it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located in the midst of the pyramid 's rubble core . In the absence of any mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus , and in the absence of any likely candidate for the king 's tomb at Thebes , it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos , as suggested by Harvey . Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in recent years , as well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose 's cult , argue for the importance of the king 's Abydos cult .

Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle , eyes , anus , and genitalia . Striped hooves are a common trait , quite noticeable on Appaloosas , but not unique to the breed . The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the iris ; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back , to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds .

A study at University College London by Maguire , et al ..

Whether having a bigger hippocampus helps an individual to become a better cab driver , or if finding shortcuts for a living makes an individual 's hippocampus grow is yet to be elucidated . However , in that study , Maguire et al. examined the correlation between size of the grey matter and length of time that had been spent as a taxi driver , and found a positive correlation between the length of time an individual had spent as a taxi driver and the volume of the right hippocampus . It was found that the total volume of the hippocampus remained constant , from the control group vs. taxi drivers . That is to say that the posterior portion of a taxi driver 's hippocampus is indeed increased , but at the expense of the anterior portion .

It is migratory , but it is one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn . When breeding , it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes . These trees are typically at least 5 metres ( 16 ft ) high , with undergrowth that is an open , poor to medium mix of grasses , bracken , nettles or similar plants . Its breeding habitat is quite specific , and even near relatives do not share it ; for example , the willow warbler ( P. trochilus ) prefers younger trees , while the wood warbler ( P. sibilatrix ) prefers less undergrowth . In winter , the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub , and is not so dependent on trees . It is often found near water , unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats . There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas , especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London . These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis , so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally , although some undoubtedly are . \n"}

{"text": " Individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer , and cancer is a genetic disease . The process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events . Mutations occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide . Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring , they can affect the behavior of cells , sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently . There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process ; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death , but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages . An internal process of natural selection occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth , creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of the body . \n"}

{"text": " Because no seismographs were close enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the earthquakes began , employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly . An infrasound station is also being established , which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing . These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents , and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes . Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007 – 2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm , collect samples , and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region . The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm . Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow . Because of this , carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface . The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide , which is normal for non @-@ eruptive events . \n"}

The Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts , but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts , and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session . Later that year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional , but a federal court soon overturned that decision . Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats ' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States . By 1871 , however , he had changed his mind and supported blacks ' right to testify .

They held power for a while , and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution .

In order to accurately portray Master Chief , Cudmore watched the Landfall shorts by Neill Blomkamp and read the Halo novels for the history of the character , having already played the games . Cudmore expressed interest in the history of Master Chief , the character 's view on war and his role as a soldier , as he was only required to portray a utilitarian character in the series . Cudmore thinks the character is torn between aiding the cadets and completing his mission , but Master Chief 's confidence and actions inspire the cadets . \n"}

{"text": " Scientists analyzing the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time . If correct , this would explain many of Europa 's features . Europa 's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean . Europa 's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell , how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean , and even how long the ocean has been liquid . Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes . When there is too much stress , it cracks . A tilt in Europa 's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought . The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day , completing one precession period over several months . A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa 's ocean . Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa 's ocean liquid , and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces . This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer . Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa 's axis . \n"}

{"text": " Each enemy has a meter , called a chain counter , consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells . Attacks by different roles have different effects ; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets . The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy . When the chain counter reaches a preset amount , different for each enemy , the enemy is placed into Stagger State . In this mode , the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air . The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions . The roles consist of Commando , a warrior @-@ type role ; Ravager , a black mage @-@ type role which uses damage @-@ dealing magic ; Medic , a White Mage @-@ type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments ; Saboteur , which use magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses ; Synergist , which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses ; and Sentinel , which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin . Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles , but the player has access to all of them later in the game ( although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them ) . The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle , which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle . The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle . \n"}

{"text": " Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues . They are divided into four classes ( Type I – IV ) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction . Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy . Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death . Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross @-@ linked by antigen . Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction . This is also called antibody @-@ dependent ( or cytotoxic ) hypersensitivity , and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies . Immune complexes ( aggregations of antigens , complement proteins , and IgG and IgM antibodies ) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions . Type IV hypersensitivity ( also known as cell @-@ mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity ) usually takes between two and three days to develop . Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases , but may also involve contact dermatitis ( poison ivy ) . These reactions are mediated by T cells , monocytes , and macrophages . \n"}

The Portuguese Prince Regent , the future King John VI , with his incapacitated mother , Queen Maria I of Portugal and the Royal Court , escaped to the colony of Brazil in 1808 . With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 , there were calls for the return of the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon ; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro , where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom , and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe . However , those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was not right for Portugal to be governed from a colony . On the other hand , leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the elevation of Brazil from the rank of a colony , so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother @-@ country . Brazilian nationalists also supported the move , because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal , but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy . \n"}

However , removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest . Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams , removing the four dams would create a hole in the energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable . Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer , as submerged riffles , rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams . Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River . However , aside from restoring salmon runs , dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable , that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads , and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water . Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow in order to create a current in the four lower reservoirs , and recreation and tourism would likely benefit . \n"}

Kiedis became dependent on heroin , leaving the rest of the group to work on much of the album 's material by themselves . The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album , where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use . When Slovak was under the influence , he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a \" shuffling \" fashion , which became the inspiration for the song \" Skinny Sweaty Man \" from the band 's next album . After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab , he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan . Slovak felt a deep connection to the album ; he reflected in his diary \" It was so fun . I 'm so extremely proud of everybody 's work — it is at times genius . \" Slovak was the subject of the songs \" Skinny Sweaty Man \" , \" Me and My Friends \" , & \" No Chump Love Sucker \" . He was nicknamed \" Slim Bob Billy \" , \" Slim \" , or \" Huckleberry \" , and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo . On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , Slovak experimented with different musical styles , playing the sitar on the song \" Behind the Sun \" . \n"}

{"text": " In a continuous distillation , the system is kept in a steady state or approximate steady state . Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation . Such constant quantities include feed input rate , output stream rates , heating and cooling rates , reflux ratio , and temperatures , pressures , and compositions at every point ( location ) . Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed , heating , ambient temperature , or condensing , steady state is normally maintained . This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation , apart from the minimum amount of ( easily instrumentable ) surveillance ; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant , product rate and quality are also constant .

{"text": " The movement of Andalusian horses is extended , elevated , cadenced and harmonious , with a balance of roundness and forward movement . Poor elevation , irregular tempo , and excessive winging ( sideways movement of the legs from the knee down ) are discouraged by breed registry standards . Andalusians are known for their agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly , such as advanced collection and turns on the haunches . A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian , Arabian and Anglo @-@ Arabian horses while moving at the trot . Andalusians were found to overtrack less ( the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print ) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints , movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed . The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed 's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse . \n"}

When they took over the series , they wanted many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the Simpson family and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other . They wanted to produce Treehouse of Horror episodes , episodes about Sideshow Bob , Itchy & Scratchy and several \" format @-@ bending \" episodes such as \" 22 Short Films About Springfield \" , for which Oakley wrote the Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers scene , the latter being his favorite character . They aimed for \" at least two episodes per season that ' pushed the envelope ' , [ and ] expanded the definition of what an episode could be . \" This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced . Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored , such as divorce .

The song was called \" Malaysia \" because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that sounded like the name of the city Kuala Lumpur . The number 32 in the title is a reference to the fact that the song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 bars . Originally \" Uneri \" had been envisioned as a rock song , but the band decided against this after creating \" Night Fishing Is Good \" . The band 's musical director suggested that they perform the song acoustically instead , which led to the final studio arrangement of \" Uneri \" . \n"}

After the death of Severus in 210 the Romans withdrew back to Hadrian 's Wall , which would be the frontier until Roman authority in Britain collapsed in the fifth century . \n"}

{"text": " Although many South Pasadena residents opposed the division of the city that the parkway would bring , the city 's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections . The state , which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it , approved the route on April 4 , 1936 . The route used the Arroyo Seco 's west bank to near Hough Street , where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway ( now Arroyo Parkway ) in Pasadena . Another project , the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel , was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods . A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938 , including Chicago 's Lake Shore Drive , full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey , and Robert Moses 's parkway system in New York City . The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points . Although , in some areas , it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange , other locations required folded diamonds , or , as the engineers called them , \" compressed cloverleafs \" , where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps , ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit . The highway was designed with two 11 – 12 foot ( 3 @.@ 4 @-@ 3 @.@ 7 m ) lanes and one ten @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) shoulder in each direction , with the wider inside ( passing ) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete . The differently @-@ colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes . ( By mid @-@ 1939 , the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity ; except on a short piece in South Pasadena , these were also paved with Portland cement . So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway , about 50 \" safety bays \" were constructed in 1949 and 1950 . ) The engineers used a design speed of 45 miles per hour ( 72 kilometres per hour ) , superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this . ( The road is now posted at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . ) Despite the freeway design , many parkway characteristics were incorporated , such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road . \n"}

{"text": " Some tissues such as muscles can be made transparent , provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light .

Other structures cannot be made transparent , notably the retinas or equivalent light @-@ absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light to be able to function . The camera @-@ type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque . Finally , some structures are visible for a reason , such as to lure prey . For example , the nematocysts ( stinging cells ) of the transparent siphonophore Agalma okenii resemble small copepods . Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of larvae , including coelenterates , siphonophores , salps ( floating tunicates ) , gastropod molluscs , polychaete worms , many shrimplike crustaceans , and fish ; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented , resembling the seabed or shores where they live . Adult comb jellies and jellyfish obey the rule , often being mainly transparent . Cott suggests this follows the more general rule that animals resemble their background : in a transparent medium like seawater , that means actually being transparent . The small Amazon river fish Microphilypnus amazonicus and the shrimps it associates with , Pseudopalaemon gouldingi , are so transparent as to be \" almost invisible \" ; further , these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled ( disruptively patterned ) according to the local background in the environment . \n"}
{"text": " The Breves causae and Argumenta belong to a pre @-@ Vulgate tradition of manuscripts . The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters . These chapter numbers , like the numbers for the canon tables , are not used on the text pages of the Gospels . It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used , even if the manuscript had been completed , because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text . The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists . The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order : first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew , followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark , then , quite oddly , come the Argumenta of both Luke and John , followed by their Breves causae . This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow , although in the latter instance , the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary . In other insular manuscripts , such as the Lindisfarne Gospels , the Book of Armagh , and the Echternach Gospels , each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it . The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K.

{"text": " Like other Pelvicachromis species , P. pulcher is sexually dimorphic . Males have pointed pelvic , dorsal , and anal fins , while the female 's pelvic , dorsal , and anal fins are more rounded in appearance . In addition , males are larger , lack the gold sheen to the dorsal fin and have a more elongated , spade @-@ shaped caudal fin . Despite the suggestion in the aquarium literature that the species forms monogamous pairs , the formation of polygynous harems is not uncommon in the natural habitat . The species are secretive cave spawners ( speleophils ) although detailed information on their reproductive biology in the wild is limited . In the wild , the species is known to breed in holes excavated beneath aquatic and semi @-@ aquatic plants . In captivity , artificial caves are readily accepted as breeding sites , however , these too are excavated prior to egg @-@ laying . The eggs are adhesive and are frequently laid in rows of ca . 10 on the upper surface of the cave and produce a clutch that ranges in size from 40 to 100 . Both the male and female provide active brood care , typically lasting 21 – 28 days , which includes guarding , herding , and feeding . It is noteworthy , however , that the female is predominantly responsible for fry care , while the male is primarily involved in territorial defence . As in all Pelvicachromis species , the gender ratio of female to male fry increases with pH . This ratio is also known to vary at different locales in the wild . Breeding pairs of P. pulcher have been known to adopt similarly aged fry from conspecifics in aquarium trials , and it has been suggested this may be an adaption to reduce predation on their own fry . Male colour polymorphism may be indicative of behavioural differences . For example , red males obtained from a single site were found to be more aggressive and more polygamous than yellow males obtained from the same site . In addition , the species has been demonstrated to engage in cooperative territorial defence where multiple males defend a single territory . \n"}

Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader . Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums , while more advanced ones developed shorter mandibles , which shifted the head 's centre of gravity . The skull grew larger , especially the cranium , while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull . The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach . The number of premolars , incisors and canines decreased . The cheek teeth ( molars and premolars ) became larger and more specialized , especially after elephants started to switch from C3 @-@ plants to C4 @-@ grasses , which caused their teeth to undergo a three @-@ fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago . Only in the last million year or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs . The upper second incisors grew into tusks , which varied in shape from straight , to curved ( either upward or downward ) , to spiralled , depending on the species . Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors . Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry such as their middle ear anatomy and the internal testes of the males . \n"}

Thomas Looney , an English schoolteacher who identified personality characteristics in Shakespeare 's works — especially Hamlet — that painted the author as an eccentric aristocratic poet , a drama and sporting enthusiast with a classical education who had travelled extensively to Italy . He discerned close affinities between the poetry of Oxford and that of Shakespeare in the use of motifs and subjects , phrasing , and rhetorical devices , which led him to identify Oxford as the author . After his Shakespeare Identified was published in 1920 , Oxford rapidly replaced Bacon as the most popular alternative candidate . \n"}

{"text": " Route 12 was added to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro , and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915 . Before a highway was constructed through the Imperial San Dunes , travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma . The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together . The road was completed by October 1912 , and portions were still visible into the 2010s . The Ocean @-@ to @-@ Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915 , and a new plank road was opened that year which became state @-@ maintained in 1917 , and used a foundation of wooden rails , with the planks bound together by steel , as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails .

{"text": " Amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins , and lack claws , defensive armour , or spines . Nevertheless , they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive . The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce . This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip . The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic . Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs ( Xenopus laevis ) , which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape . Caecilians have been little studied in this respect , but the Cayenne caecilian ( Typhlonectes compressicauda ) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil . In some salamanders , the skin is poisonous . The rough @-@ skinned newt ( Taricha granulosa ) from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) , the most toxic non @-@ protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish . Handling the newts does not cause harm , but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly . In feeding trials , fish , frogs , reptiles , birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible . The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake ( Thamnophis sirtalis ) . In locations where both snake and salamander co @-@ exist , the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity . Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity . Some frogs and toads are toxic , the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back . These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul @-@ tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms . Altogether , over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated . \n"}

American philosopher Michael Martin argues that it is not necessarily true that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God , suggesting that there could be alternative explanations : he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and , even if a supernatural explanation is necessary , it does not have to be God ( polytheism is a viable alternative ) .

{"text": " DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome . In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double @-@ strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages ( interstrand crosslinks or ICLs ) . This can eventually lead to malignant tumors , or cancer as per the two hit hypothesis . \n"}

{"text": " As the turnpike did not use any state tax revenue for maintenance , the pavement began to deteriorate rapidly , and crews faced difficulty keeping up with the snow in winter conditions in a winter storm during 1960 . In the early 1960s , many senior positions in the Kansas Turnpike Authority were cut , and thanks to this and other austerity measures such as targeting maintenance to save costs in the future , the turnpike slowly became profitable . By 1966 , it was clear that the turnpike had not been built to the higher standards of the Interstate Highway system ; the roadway had developed ruts and other issues due to deferred maintenance . To temporarily fix the problem , a layer of asphalt oil and a layer of sand and asphalt was used to fill in the ruts , and graded rock coated with asphalt was used to seal the road . Since the road had been originally constructed at the same time , and not built in segments over a period of time , similar maintenance issues appeared along the whole length of the road at the same time . Bridges and pavement were repaired on a rotating basis , to stagger the cost of needed repairs . The bridge over the Kansas River was widened and replaced after 1973 . As economic conditions improved for the Authority , equipment was slowly replaced , and workers were given pay increases , both of which were badly needed . \n"}

{"text": " The abundances of the noble gases in the universe decrease as their atomic numbers increase . Helium is the most common element in the universe after hydrogen , with a mass fraction of about 24 % . Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis , but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis ( and , to a very slight degree , the alpha decay of heavy elements ) . Abundances on Earth follow different trends ; for example , helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere . The reason is that there is no primordial helium in the atmosphere ; due to the small mass of the atom , helium cannot be retained by the Earth 's gravitational field . Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth 's crust , and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits . The abundance of argon , on the other hand , is increased as a result of the beta decay of potassium @-@ 40 , also found in the Earth 's crust , to form argon @-@ 40 , which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System . This process is the base for the potassium @-@ argon dating method . Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere , in what has been called the missing xenon problem ; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth 's crust . After the discovery of xenon dioxide , a research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in the quartz . Radon is formed in the lithosphere as from the alpha decay of radium . It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated . Due to its high radioactivity , radon presents a significant health hazard ; it is implicated in an estimated 21 @,@ 000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone . \n"}

The sole composer featured in the concert is Nobuo Uematsu , a Japanese video game composer best known for his work at Square Enix , who is considered one of the most famous and respected composers in the video game community . He has composed the music for dozens of video games , including the majority of the Final Fantasy series , and his compositions had been a significant component of the Symphonic Fantasies concert . Böcker has said that he considers Uematsu to be \" the most famous composer of video game music and in general one of the most influential \" , and that Uematsu 's 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002 was a big influence on his own concerts . The decision to focus the event on Uematsu was made in part due to Uematsu 's own desire to one day hear a concert based on his compositions as a whole ; he was also very interested in hearing more experimental arrangements of his pieces than have been done in the past after watching the Symphonic Fantasies concert . A website was set up for news and updates on the concert , including video messages from Nobuo Uematsu himself . Tickets for the concert went on sale on December 1 , 2010 , and were sold out within 12 hours , prompting the addition of a second performance to be held earlier in the afternoon of the same day .

The run @-@ up to the June convention in Philadelphia coincided with Hitler 's advance in Western Europe , and delegates had second thoughts about running an isolationist , let alone a young one without national experience such as Dewey . Willkie , who had spoken out against isolationism , and who was a successful executive , was an attractive possibility . Willkie made speeches widely , including in a tour of New England that paid off with promises of support , though delegates might first support a favorite son candidate for a ballot or two . Important converts to Willkie 's cause included Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen and Massachusetts Governor Leverett Saltonstall . The move to Willkie was reflected in polls ; he went from 3 to 29 percent in the seven weeks before the convention , while Dewey , the frontrunner , fell from 67 to 47 percent . \n"}

{"text": " Plumage is regularly moulted ; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \" non @-@ breeding \" plumage , or — in the Humphrey @-@ Parkes terminology — \" basic \" plumage ; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey @-@ Parkes system as \" alternate \" plumages . Moulting is annual in most species , although some may have two moults a year , and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years . Moulting patterns vary across species . In passerines , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first . When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced , the outermost tertiaries begin to drop . After the innermost tertiaries are moulted , the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( centrifugal moult ) . The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap . A small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flightless . As a general rule , the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair . Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae . The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers , in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail . The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward , secondaries inward , and the tail from center outward . Before nesting , the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly . The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation . \n"}

He added that in these stories , the main division was \" no longer Good and Evil \" as it had been in previous Adventures , but \" Truth and Error \" . Apostolidès opined that despite being a \" fussy and somewhat ridiculous character \" , through his scientific achievements Calculus grows to the \" stature of a giant \" in this arc , eclipsing Sir Francis Haddock ( from The Secret of the Unicorn ) as the series ' \" founding ancestor \" . He goes on to claim that in becoming the \" sacred ancestor \" , the voyage to the moon becomes \" a mystical quest \" with science as its guiding religion . Drawing comparisons between this arc and the Prisoners of the Sun story , he drew symbolic links between the scientific centre and the Inca Temple of the Sun , but noted that here Calculus was the \" high priest \" rather than the sacrificial victim as he had been in the previous story . Moving on to discuss the moon rocket in these stories , Apostolidès described it as a phallic object which penetrated the \" virgin territory \" of the moon . At the same time , he described the rocket as a \" maternal belly \" in which the space explorers slept . Commenting specifically on Explorers on the Moon he commented that the protagonists of the story reverted to childhood when exploring the moon , believing that they had treated it like a theme park . \n"}

{"text": " The criminal trial continued for most of the summer and Carrouges , Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence . Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant , although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case . Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite 's maidservants also gave evidence and , as was the custom of the day for people of low birth , they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony . During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris , although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite 's cousin , Thomin du Bois . In his evidence , Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife 's testimony , while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire . In his statement , Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival . Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime was supposed to have been committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty @-@ five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question . A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris 's alibi was true . Le Gris ' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it , a squire named Jean Beloteau , was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed . On 15 September , with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England , the parlement handed down its verdict : As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case , the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386 . \n"}

{"text": " The Indian Mahayana schools were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness ( svasaṃvedana ) . Dharmakīrti accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogacara school , comparing it to lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects . This was strictly rejected by Mādhyamika scholars like Candrakīrti . Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by emptiness , they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness . These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker Śāntarakṣita . In Śāntarakṣita 's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the two truths doctrine . Thus he states : \" By relying on the Mind @-@ Only system , know that external entities do not exist . And by relying on this Middle Way system , know that no self exists at all , even in that [ mind ] . \" \n"}

Low heat input , caused by low welding current or high welding speed , can limit penetration and cause the weld bead to lift away from the surface being welded . If there is too much heat input , however , the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase . Additionally , if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective , causing porosity within the weld .

Traditionally , nuclear reactors have been used , although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available .

Therefore , neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons , especially hydrogen , which is essentially invisible in the X @-@ ray diffraction . Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water , H2O , and heavy water , D2O . \n"}

In 1980 , newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan 's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits . To finance these deficits , the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital . As foreign investors ' demand for U.S. dollars grew , the dollar 's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985 . The U.S. trade deficit grew to $ 160 billion in 1985 ( $ 341 billion in 2012 dollars ) as a result of the dollar 's strong appreciation . The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States ' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions , in what became known as the Plaza Accord . The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate , but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase . To address these concerns , the G7 ( now G8 ) held a summit in Paris in 1987 , where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies , in what became known as the Louvre Accord . This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies . Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s , with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot @-@ com bubble . After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot @-@ com bubble the country 's trade deficit grew , the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties , and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001 . \n"}

Each king had a son designated to be heir apparent , while his other sons and brothers were given the rank of marquess and ruled over small marquessates where a portion of the taxes went to their private purse . Although kings and marquesses enjoyed many privileges , the imperial court was at times aggressive towards them to check their power . Starting with Emperor Gaozu 's reign , thousands of noble families , including those from the royal houses of Qi , Chu , Yan , Zhao , Han , and Wei from the Warring States period , were forcibly moved to the vicinity of the capital Chang 'an .

{"text": " It has been argued that although BLEU has significant advantages , there is no guarantee that an increase in BLEU score is an indicator of improved translation quality . [ 14 ] There is an inherent , systemic problem with any metric based on comparing with one or a few reference translations : in real life , sentences can be translated in many different ways , sometimes with no overlap . Therefore , the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed . HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators ; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation . \n"}

{"text": " Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy ( RE ) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country 's generation mix . Energy sector regulators implement that policy — thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid . Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects . Such functions include issuing licenses , setting performance standards , monitoring the performance of regulated firms , determining the price level and structure of tariffs , establishing uniform systems of accounts , arbitrating stakeholder disputes ( like interconnection cost allocations ) , performing management audits , developing agency human resources ( expertise ) , reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities , and coordinating decisions with other government agencies . Thus , regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments . In addition , the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security . The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost @-@ containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies . Since policies are not self @-@ implementing , energy sector regulators become a key facilitator ( or blocker ) of renewable energy investments . \n"}

One of the reasons for the CIP suspension was to give military officers a signal that Washington was unhappy with Diem and therefore increase the prospects of a coup , as well as to try and foster urban resentment towards Diem among those that had previously benefited from the CIP . Another was that Diem might change his policy direction in accordance with US wishes , although they considered this to be unlikely .

Damage to the flocculonodular lobe ( vestibulocerebellum ) may show up as a loss of equilibrium and , in particular , an altered walking gait , with a wide stance that indicates difficulty in balancing . Damage to the lateral zone , or the cerebrocerebellum , results in problems with skilled voluntary and planned movements . This can cause errors in the force , direction , speed and amplitude of movements . Some manifestations include hypotonia ( decreased muscle tone ) , dysarthria ( problems with speech articulation ) , dysmetria ( problems judging distances or ranges of movement ) , dysdiadochokinesia ( inability to perform rapid alternating movements ) , impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon , and intention tremor ( involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups ) . Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole @-@ body movements , whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs . Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination ; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands , as well as difficulties in speed .

By 1845 , John Lindley , the first English systematist unhappily acknowledged the great diversity in the circumscription of the family , and that it had expanded vastly , with many subdivisions . As he saw it , the Liliaceae were already paraphyletic ( \" catch @-@ all \" ) , being all Liliales not included in the other orders , but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better . He recognized 133 genera and 1200 species . By the time of the next major British classification – that of Bentham and Hooker in 1883 ( published in Latin ) – several of Lindley 's other families had already been absorbed into the Liliaceae . Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly , and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary , eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4 @,@ 500 species , within the order Liliales in the Cronquist system ( 1981 ) . Cronquist merged the Liliaceae with the Amaryllidaceae , making this one of the largest monocotyledon families . \n"}

In 1823 the Commissioner of Customs for Agra , George Saunders , installed a line of customs posts along the Ganges and Yamuna rivers from Mirzapur to Allahabad that would eventually evolve into the Inland Customs Line . The main aim was to prevent salt from being smuggled from the south and west but there was also a secondary line running from Allahabad to Nepal to prevent smuggling from the Northwest frontier . The annexation of Sindh and the Punjab allowed the line to be extended north @-@ west by G. H. Smith , who had become Commissioner of Customs in 1834 . Smith exempted items such as tobacco and iron from taxation to concentrate on salt and was responsible for expanding and improving the line , increasing its budget to 790 @,@ 000 rupees per year and the staff to 6 @,@ 600 men .

{"text": " However , the game often considered the first true survival horror , due to having the most influence on Resident Evil , was the 1989 release Sweet Home , for the Nintendo Entertainment System . The gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory , while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures , which could lead to permanent death for any of the characters , thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival . It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game , mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game . Developed by Capcom , the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil , which also borrowed various other elements from the game , such as its mansion setting , \" opening door \" load screen , death animations , multiple endings depending on which characters survive , dual character paths , individual character skills , limited item management , story told through diary entries and frescos , emphasis on atmosphere , and horrific imagery . The latter prevented its release in the Western world , though its influence was felt through Resident Evil , which was originally intended to be a remake of the game . Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game .

{"text": " Sporadic experiments with numbered shirts took place in the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on . The first major match in which numbers were worn was the 1933 FA Cup Final between Everton and Manchester City . Rather than the numbers being added to the clubs ' existing strips , two special sets , one white and one red , were made for the final and allocated to the two teams by the toss of a coin . The Everton players wore numbers 1 – 11 , while the City players wore 12 – 22 . It was not until around the time of the Second World War that numbering became standard , with teams wearing numbers 1 – 11 . Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number , specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play , a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was usually reserved for the team 's main striker . In contrast to the usual practice , Scottish club Celtic wore numbers on their shorts rather than their shirts until 1975 for international matches , and until 1994 for domestic matches . The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture , with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available .

{"text": " For instance , Traherne passionately critiques Roman Catholicism in Roman Forgeries ( 1673 ) — the only work published during his lifetime . It is a polemical treatise in the form of a dialogue between two men — a Protestant and a Roman Catholic . Relying on the Scriptures and the pronouncements of the First Council of Nicaea to formulate the idea of a legitimate church authority , Traherne criticises the state of the contemporary Catholic Church and claims through a conspiracy theory that because the Vatican has had control over the manuscripts that the Catholic Church was in a position to corrupt , misuse or suppress documents to support its claim to authority . The abusive nature of the narrator 's critique of the Church of Rome is in sharp contrast to the tenor of Traherne 's poetry or his other writings on theological topics . However , Traherne takes a less polemic tone in the posthumously published Christian Ethicks ( 1675 ) in which he explores theological implications of Calvinist thought on freedom and necessity . In this work , Traherne refuses to define ethics as a secular phenomenon — instead pointing to a firm reliance on the will of God . Because of human limitations and failings , one cannot build a suitable and coherent moral system of beliefs — those virtues must derive from a divine source and their reward from perceiving the infinite love of God at the root of all things . \n"}

However , this equilibrium is unstable : because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales , R must change over time . When R changes , all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem ; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself .

Hol based this view on two speeches given by Oscar in 1882 , one of them at the closing of the parliamentary session that year and hence before the 1882 general election . Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland , the Commander at Akershus Fortress , located nearby the Norwegian Parliament , was known as a staunch conservative . In 1880 , he had called for Parliament to increase the military contingent in the city . The Chief of Police supported this request ; in a letter to the Ministry of Justice and the Police he stated that there was a need for preparedness regarding the political situation , as a possible pretext for \" disturbances and demonstrations \" . Otto Nyquist , a personal friend of the King , was instated in 1882 as commander of the battalion stationed in Kristiania . In late 1883 , Oscar suggested that the storage of bolts of rifles in depots around the country be disconnected , to prevent a situation in which uprising peasantry turned the Army 's own weapons against them . Secret talks on a coup d 'état supported by the military were held between Oscar and Christian Selmer at the Scanian castle Sofiero in 1883 , and the newspaper Morgenbladet publicly supported such a solution . \n"}

{"text": " The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention . However , semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language . Rather , when studying the way in which words and signs are used , it is often the case that words have different meanings , depending on the social context of use . An important example of this is the process called deixis , which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered . Such words are , for example , the word , \" I \" ( which designates the person speaking ) , \" now \" ( which designates the moment of speaking ) , and \" here \" ( which designates the position of speaking ) . Signs also change their meanings over time , as the conventions governing their usage gradually change . The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics . Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world . Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning . For example , in all languages , linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information , but to perform actions . Certain actions are made only through language , but nonetheless have tangible effects , e.g. the act of \" naming \" , which creates a new name for some entity , or the act of \" pronouncing someone man and wife \" , which creates a social contract of marriage . These types of acts are called speech acts , although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing . \n"}

{"text": " Aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology . In Aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \" natural places \" therein . Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone . He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \" natural place \" ( e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall ) , which led to \" natural motion \" , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . This theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows . The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it . Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target . This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general . \n"}

{"text": " As with the extinctions that occurred on other land masses during the late Pleistocene and Holocene ( known as the Quaternary extinction event ) , the disappearance of Madagascar 's megafauna is tightly linked with the arrival of humans , with nearly all extinctions dating to around the same time of the earliest evidence of human activity on the island or significantly later . The exact date of human arrival is unknown , although a radius ( arm bone ) of a Palaeopropithecus ingens with distinct cut marks from the removal of flesh with sharp objects dates to approximately 2325 ± 43 BP ( 2366 – 2315 cal yr BP ) .

{"text": " In September 2007 , a report published in Nature proposed an origin for the asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater . The authors , William F. Bottke , David Vokrouhlický , and David Nesvorný , argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the Baptistina family of asteroids , the largest surviving member of which is 298 Baptistina . They proposed that the \" Chicxulub asteroid \" was also a member of this group . The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor , suggesting the impactor was a member of a rare class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites , like Baptistina . According to Bottke , the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about 170 km ( 106 mi ) across , with the other impacting body being around 60 km ( 37 mi ) in diameter . In 2011 , new data from the Wide @-@ field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago . This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater , as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years . In 2010 , another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid P / 2010 A2 , a member of the Flora family of asteroids , as a possible remnant cohort of the K / Pg impactor . \n"}

Before Irving Leonard died , he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing Play Misty for Me , a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired , and his debut as a director . The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave ( Eastwood ) , who has a casual affair with Evelyn ( Jessica Walter ) , a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night , asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner 's Misty . When Dave ends their relationship , the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker . Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year 's Monterey Jazz Festival . The film was highly acclaimed with critics , such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine , Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice , and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film , as well as Eastwood 's directorial skills and performance . Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award ( Drama ) , for her performance in the film . \n"}

The October 1942 Bradshaw 's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday , Wednesday and Fridays , taking 45 minutes in each direction . No passenger service was provided on other days . In 1946 the weakened columns gave way in a significant collapse and the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately . Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so , despite the closure of the quarry , the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget . In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included . The reasons for this are unclear , but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom . Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week . On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable , but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season , ending on 6 October . \n"}

This compound is analogous to the lighter ferrocene , ruthenocene , and osmocene , and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene . Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of + 2 ( although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes ) rather than the high + 8 state which had previously been investigated , and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state . Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes , so that trends could be more easily determined , and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier . Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound . \n"}

Results prior to the launch of the Hipparcos satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 parsecs away from Earth . Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result , namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the parallax of stars in the cluster — a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results . Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous . In particular , distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color @-@ magnitude diagram fitting favor a distance between 135 – 140 pc ; a dynamical distance from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad double Atlas favors a distance of 133 @-@ 137 pc .

In 1551 the government at the same time tried to yield profit and restore confidence in the coin by issuing yet further debased coinage and \" crying it down \" immediately afterwards . The result was panic and confusion and , to get hold of the situation , a coin of 92 @.@ 3 % silver content ( against 25 % silver content in the last debasement ) was issued within months . The bad coin prevailed over the good , however , because people had lost confidence . Northumberland admitted defeat and recruited the financial expert Thomas Gresham . After the first good harvest in four years , by late 1552 the currency was stable , prices for foodstuffs had dropped , and a basis for economic recovery had been laid . A process to centralise the administration of Crown revenue was underway and foreign debt had been eliminated . \n"}

They are so small that one space @-@ point — the smallest possible extent of space — contains an infinite number of karmic particles ( or quantity of karmic dirt ) . It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency .

The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect . The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls , which — in turn — give rise to psychic karma , causing emotional modifications within the soul . These emotions , yet again , result in influx and bondage of fresh material karma . Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material context of this universe . They are the material carrier of a soul 's desire to physically experience this world . When attracted to the consciousness , they are stored in an interactive karmic field called kārmaṇa śarīra , which emanates from the soul . Thus , karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul . When these two components — consciousness and ripened karma — interact , the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe . \n"}

Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium : B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO ; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97 % . Boron of higher purity ( > 99 % ) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds , such as BCl3 or BBr3 , either in a hydrogen atmosphere ( 2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX ) or to the point of thermal decomposition . Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen : SiO2 + C → Si + CO2 ; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O . Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite ( FeAsS ) or arsenical pyrite ( FeAs2 ) by heating ; alternatively , it can be obtained from its oxide by reduction with carbon : 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2 .

The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel . Zermelo – Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics , but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself .

In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor 's management system for industrial efficiency , Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes , improving labor productivity . Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry , delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities . Additionally , he argues that the Internet 's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements , therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought . \n"}

{"text": " DJ Kool Herc developed the style that was the blueprint for hip hop music . Herc used the record to focus on a short , heavily percussive part in it : the \" break \" . Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best , Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players . As one record reached the end of the break , he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break , which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into \" five @-@ minute loop of fury \" . This innovation had its roots in what Herc called \" The Merry @-@ Go @-@ Round , \" a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party .

From the \" Bongo Rock \" ' s break , Herc used a third record to switch to the break on \" The Mexican \" by the English rock band Babe Ruth .

According to Time , \" There was some speculation in Moscow \" that if Brezhnev didn 't succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State modelled after institutions found in , for example , East Germany ( Staatsrat ) , People 's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Republic of Romania . The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR .
